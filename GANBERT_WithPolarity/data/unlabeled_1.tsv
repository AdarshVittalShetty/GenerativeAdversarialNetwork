UNK:UNK love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)
UNK:UNK Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.  My brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time.  Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.
UNK:UNK Definitely come for Happy hour! Prices are amazing, sake bombers for $3...Great atmosphere and wait staff was incredibly nice and right on to all of our needs, didn't have to ask for a thing They were always spot on...Place gets crowded in the evening especially if you plan on sitting outside. I only wish there were one in Apollo Beach or Brandon!
UNK:UNK Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
UNK:UNK The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.  Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.
UNK:UNK Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
UNK:UNK okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!
UNK:UNK This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
UNK:UNK first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!
UNK:UNK I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
UNK:UNK Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous "bitch fizz" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.
UNK:UNK Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
UNK:UNK I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months. This is one of my mom's favorite places to eat and I can understand why. The ravioli and the miso soup are so delicious! The wine was ok and I would recommend one of their elixirs over an alcohol beverage. Still a pretty delicious place to go in Phoenix.
UNK:UNK Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while.
UNK:UNK This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside.
UNK:UNK Solid food, great device, and casual environment.  They will not leave you hungry.  Overall, it's really good.
UNK:UNK my son really enjoys islands, great food, casual kid freindly atmoshpere we go here quite a lot and seem to keep coming back
UNK:UNK Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. I'll go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and they're in the neighborhood.
UNK:UNK (Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!
UNK:UNK Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.
UNK:UNK Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.    Did you catch that?  DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
UNK:UNK No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizie's have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizie's I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.
UNK:UNK Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said "they try the best they can"  hmmmmmm isn't this a "fish" restaurant?  They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.
UNK:UNK This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.
UNK:UNK This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.
UNK:UNK The best sweet and sour soup ever!  Food is delicious and favorable.  Delivery is pretty good, nice people.
UNK:UNK Great Southwestern restaurant.  The food is incredible, especially the stacked enchiladas.  Normally I do not eat heavy foods, but this was way too good to pass up.  The chips and salsa were very tasty as well.  Service was very friendly and timely.  The interior is pedestrian at best, but still a pleasant environment.
UNK:UNK Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid.   Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley.
UNK:UNK Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
UNK:UNK This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??
UNK:UNK Great place to have a meal with family, can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place, recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list, reservations party of six or more only price range moderate, but well worth it
UNK:UNK I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!
UNK:UNK So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.  Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.
UNK:UNK Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the "express dozen" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.  The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-(
UNK:UNK I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them!   A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.  I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful.   Service was great! I'll be back!
UNK:UNK Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
UNK:UNK Had dinner and brunch, not on the same day...the dinner was good, although I thought the mandala masala could have used more flavor.  Brunch was great, tried 2 different tofu scrambles and both were very good.  Service is...let's say uninterested -- it's hard to be burdened with angst and chipper.
UNK:UNK This is a very interesting place.  Don't go here thinking it will be classy.
UNK:UNK Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!
UNK:UNK Great food and awesome service! Even better that the Chef came out and personally checked on our experience. I will be back for more delicious BBQ
UNK:UNK It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.   If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
UNK:UNK This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.
UNK:UNK Returned Sunday afternoon and was  pleasantly suprised. Happy Hour is 7 days a week 3-7 pm   ; )    I recieved great service at the bar which was friendly fast and efficient(Janessa) .I ordered couple of drafts and wings with good happy hour pricing! I will be back!
UNK:UNK Absolutely the best sushi in the valley, hands down.  The fish is fresh and their spicy tuna is like no other.  However, the service is extremely slow. We once waited 75 minutes to get our lunch and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Can't say much about the cooked food though, but the sushi is amazing.
UNK:UNK It was as good as everyone says!  And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones.  Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home.
UNK:UNK Friend and I were planning on going to Postino's next door but it was already packed at 5:30 on a Thu... Anyway we tried out Aiello's and were happily surprised. I had the Scallops Venezia and my friend had the veal. Both were very well done and the bread was delicious.
UNK:UNK I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.    Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.    Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.
UNK:UNK That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.   The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not.   Service was great.   I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)
UNK:UNK Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
UNK:UNK Excellent service and food.  Very clean.  Friendly folks.  Beautiful patio
UNK:UNK Affordable and good.  Clean restaurant.  Will return.
UNK:UNK Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.
UNK:UNK Very polite staff. Did not wait very long to be seen.
UNK:UNK Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass.
UNK:UNK Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the "hot" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value.
UNK:UNK Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
UNK:UNK Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. "bad service = bad review"
UNK:UNK Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!
UNK:UNK I'm torn.   I LOVED my $20 facial. I'll probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals.  However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldn't recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal.
UNK:UNK I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected.
UNK:UNK I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.
UNK:UNK Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
UNK:UNK Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.  There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.
UNK:UNK Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.  Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.
UNK:UNK This place is not there anymore.
UNK:UNK Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!
UNK:UNK Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast.
UNK:UNK Service was good, however my fettucine alfredo with meatballs was just OK. I would pass on this menu item the next and try something different.
UNK:UNK So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican.
UNK:UNK Good pizza. Nice and laid back. Good staff too.
UNK:UNK The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
UNK:UNK Only had a chance to experience the Oscuro (amber lager) and the pizza (the Arizona vs. Boston) so far but it's enough to make me want to come back and try more.  Lots of flat screens. Should be a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching footbal in the fall.
UNK:UNK In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio.
UNK:UNK Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.
UNK:UNK I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
UNK:UNK What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.  Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.  I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.
UNK:UNK Had the enchiladas - cheese and shredded beef - and some mini chimichangas which were both good. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Friendly service. Will be back next time I'm in Florence!
UNK:UNK Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers.   What I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (=
UNK:UNK Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait.
UNK:UNK Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.
UNK:UNK Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.
UNK:UNK A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!
UNK:UNK The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places.
UNK:UNK The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that "I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour" feeling.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.    I am hooked!
UNK:UNK After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.    I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.
UNK:UNK They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.    I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasn't fully melted.    My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.    3 stars.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  La de da.
UNK:UNK I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
UNK:UNK I thought Trader Vic's was very nice.  Food was very good.  Atmosphere was great.  Staff was very very friendly and fun.  They even gave me tons  of recommendations of places to eat in the area since I am new around here.    I recommend the lamb.
UNK:UNK Excellent service and food             enjoyed live music on patio
UNK:UNK Love Krista!
UNK:UNK nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.
UNK:UNK Love me some hidden house!   The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
UNK:UNK Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.
UNK:UNK The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.  I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.  Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.
UNK:UNK I have been graciously reminded by many people that a "bruin" is a kind of bear.  Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)
UNK:UNK This place is busy, but the kids love the pancakes so much food for the price.
UNK:UNK Mmm. The cream cheese and potato soup always perks me up when I'm getting sick, and I love their chocolate chip scones! I've had their ravioli too, they're yummy. Wildflower is homey and consistent!
UNK:UNK Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
UNK:UNK This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious.   I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.    The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!
UNK:UNK Last nights To-Go order:  Char Burger w/avocado. Burger was delicious ~ Yum!  Extra crispy french fries were perfect! Price was reasonable for a burger of this caliber.  No drive-thru No waiters Staff very friendly  I WILL BE GOING BACK!!!!
UNK:UNK Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!
UNK:UNK Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
UNK:UNK We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
UNK:UNK The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
UNK:UNK We had a delicious meal with great service.  Awesome!
UNK:UNK What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )
UNK:UNK Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile.
UNK:UNK I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
UNK:UNK Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties.   Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.
UNK:UNK We are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street.    The food is great. Love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries. They grow a lot of their own veggies. They seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are GREAT.   You get your food free on your birthday.  Gets very crowded on the weekends!  the dessert is just OK, but the shakes are great!
UNK:UNK This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.
UNK:UNK The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.
UNK:UNK Great service
UNK:UNK My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.
UNK:UNK Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.
UNK:UNK This is the best mall in Arizona.  Lots of high end shops and nice restaurants.  Except during the holidays, plenty of covered parking.
UNK:UNK Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread  large portions definitely worth the price!
UNK:UNK I much prefer drinking here to eating here.  Sometimes it is the only place close and I decide to order food and I always regret it.  I'm a vegetarian so maybe I'm too limited and the burgers are awesome   So stick to traditional fare.  The salads my daughter and I had yesterday were pathetic
UNK:UNK It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal.  We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on.  We got a 'can't we get you to stay' call which felt like desperation on their part.  My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left (as most do) and the cost was not worth it anymore.  I would not recommend them to my friends.
UNK:UNK Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle.
UNK:UNK Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza
UNK:UNK The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here.  The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time.   Seriously though, the beer is awesome.
UNK:UNK Ok...this place is *REALLY* outdated...HOWEVER, the food was great.  The Veggie plate was gone fast (barely got to taste any of it ... wife loved it) and my Gryo plate was very good as well.  This is the ONLY other place that I've been to where the Felafel was great!  I've been to only one other place...
UNK:UNK - the location is excellent - the food is mediocre, and milder than they advertise - the wait staff is polite and bland.  At several opportunities, they were missing for more than 5 mins. - the bill will be higher than anyone expects  Bottom line:  don't bother
UNK:UNK Large Goodwill location (formally a PetSmart), but dark like a cave. This one is hit or miss... It is clean for a Goodwill (I've seen some pretty dirty ones). Just need to keep checking to find the treasures here.
UNK:UNK There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.
UNK:UNK Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!
UNK:UNK Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!
UNK:UNK Bad service, great food, awful coffee.
UNK:UNK Meh.  Plus for cool decor. Minus for being in a strip mall (but hey it's Phoenix...)  Cinnamon Roll was good.  Awesome icing. Toluca Brizza was unique, but nothing spectacular.  it would be a good place for groups, with a vast menu (that i hear is very vegan friendly), but they are better places around town for brunch, both in terms of quality and price points.
UNK:UNK 3 syllables for this place.  A-MAZ-ING!  The best Phoenix has to offer.
UNK:UNK They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back.
UNK:UNK The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.
UNK:UNK I had a nice lunch here on a hot summer day. $12 for a good pastrami sandwich with crispy seasoned fries and an iced tea. Definitely recommend the food.  Line was very short on a Friday afternoon. Soda machine ran out of ice, but they filled my cup with ice from ice maker in back and quickly filled machine with more ice.
UNK:UNK Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
UNK:UNK This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.  Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
UNK:UNK This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese.  They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs.   You don't pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food.  Their iced coffee are a great deal!! It's a 20oz cup for less than $3!
UNK:UNK I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.  The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.
UNK:UNK Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.
UNK:UNK This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan. I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot. Get the pedi, no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else. Have fun. I do..Customer service - top end. Thanks
UNK:UNK They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
UNK:UNK The only place I go for a nice lunch on Mill. Two words: Beet Salad. Thank me later.
UNK:UNK New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!
UNK:UNK I only go for the movies or when I know what I'm getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit.
UNK:UNK I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
UNK:UNK RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!
UNK:UNK Probably one of the better gay bars in town.. friendly.. decent crowd.. reasonable prices.. after hopping from one to another this place was our favorite. Lots of furry muscle bears too! Nice!!
UNK:UNK just say no.  this place is truly awful.  too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.
UNK:UNK I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!!   If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.
UNK:UNK If you need something obscure, or you need to get everything you need in one place, then here you go.  I also love how many different 1 shot mini bottles BevMo has to choose from.
UNK:UNK Handmade, in-store fine candies aand chocolates are awesome (way better than See's, but higher priced).  The owners are really great people!
UNK:UNK I have been here many times, pretty much can't go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly.
UNK:UNK This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The "sassy" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it.
UNK:UNK Our visit to Scottsdale brought us into Fountain Hills to look for a home. While we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about. That's when we happened upon this place. The pizza was fantastic!!! It made us want to move here even more. Delicious!
UNK:UNK LOVE the food!!!!
UNK:UNK These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great.
UNK:UNK Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.
UNK:UNK I love Victoria's Secret, but this store has a terrible selection, and the employees are rude here.  I have visited many locations all over the U.S., and was not happy with this one. They were very pushy about trying to get me to buy bras that I did not like as I only buy a certain style of bra from here.  I also thought that there selection of PINK merchandise was severely lacking.
UNK:UNK I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.  The service has been very good, some seasonal workers and some regulars.  I bring friends from out of town here for good pizza and wings.  I would recommend it any time.
UNK:UNK One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.
UNK:UNK We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters. Honestly, fellow Yelpers, we even didn't like the one's you gave 4 stars. Where's the flavor? We tried Asian Grill delivery tonight - wonderful...delicious! We finally found excellent Chinese food delivery in Chandler!
UNK:UNK 1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.
UNK:UNK I have since revisited the store several times and I would be remiss if I didn't update my rant.  Debbie the owner has been friendly and helpful ever since I asked nicely.  I suppose with the amount of lookie loos or window shoppers in Old Town I can relate to the lack of enthusiasm.
UNK:UNK Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!
UNK:UNK Kind of cold, otherwise your typical Paradise Bakery. Delicious chicken Caesar salads.
UNK:UNK I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.
UNK:UNK If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50) have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...
UNK:UNK I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude. Avoid this place!
UNK:UNK I have friends that I meet there once a month for a delicious greasy spoon breakfast and these guys never disappoint.  I am a breakfast maven so love their hash browns most of all.  If I'm feeling a little decadent, I order a side of gravy with them.  It's really nice to sit outside during the cooler months and have some fries and a shake too!
UNK:UNK Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
UNK:UNK One of my regular buffet stops. great service and average food.
UNK:UNK Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.
UNK:UNK Great brewery and open atmosphere!  Had the Buffalo Chickens sandwich.  It was great.  Washed it down with a Sunspot Golden Ale which was awesome.  Will return to sample the other beers.  Making a reservation online worked like a champ.
UNK:UNK I was severely mislead by Frank A's, "It's hot, but the food ain't bad." review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.
UNK:UNK I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!
UNK:UNK Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...
UNK:UNK I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
UNK:UNK This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
UNK:UNK I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening.  The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better.
UNK:UNK Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!
UNK:UNK The Vig is a great place to meet up for a drink. I haven't found too many other places that serve Hoegaarden (my favorite beer). The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, and the food is pretty good as well. I'd recommend the "Big Azz Burger" or the "Hot Vings"!
UNK:UNK absolutely love this place. It is a fru-fru hang out joint that isn't pretentious.   The cucumber lemonade has become my favorite non-alcoholic drink and their bruschetta is always the best!
UNK:UNK Jimmy Johns has got to be my guilty pleasure. Love the Beach Club and the salt and vinegar chips. This location is fairly new and it does the JJ chain well. Although they do keep the music louder than I'd like. Great place, great sandwiches.
UNK:UNK I have been to St. Francis twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. The brunch deserves 5 stars, we had great service and great food. Their bread was AMAZING! We had great service for dinner, but the food wasn't up to what I was expecting. Things were a little bland and the sauces on all the dishes was a little heavy. However, overall I would definitely recommend them.
UNK:UNK This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.
UNK:UNK My buddy and I (along with our dogs) stop by here every morning on the way to dog park. Hot coffee and hot women making the coffee! Love this place!
UNK:UNK Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does. I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
UNK:UNK Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines. The staff is super nice and there are magazines to read while your there. If they could just turn up the AC a little bit and put ESPN on more than two of the TVs.
UNK:UNK Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the "man" salad.   The salad was really good!!!!  On a hot summer day, the salad is a perfect choice for lunch!!!
UNK:UNK overpriced for an average course
UNK:UNK These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.  I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.
UNK:UNK 6 cities in 10 days.....no significant delays, great service and the food was even good. Get rid of the lowly 757's to Hawaii and give me the fancy LAX-JFK 777 for all 5 hour flights, plus redo the overhead compartments in the 767's and I'll give Delta 5 stars.   Great job with the merger as the employees/customers seem much, much happier!
UNK:UNK Good, but the salad was not as good as remembered.  Still think its a great spot in scootsdale!
UNK:UNK Beware the latte. Otherwise this is a typical Circle K. Come to think of it, the latte is probably typical of Circle K as well.
UNK:UNK food is ok, but service is very slow!
UNK:UNK Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!
UNK:UNK Had the signature Black Chile entree.  It was fabulous!
UNK:UNK A definite favorite in the neighborhood.  The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive.
UNK:UNK A pain to get in and out of. I dread each trip I have to take to this place.
UNK:UNK The best gyro you will have in Arizona... or maybe anywhere.  Love the grocery selection. Everyone there is really nice. And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
UNK:UNK Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.
UNK:UNK Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!
UNK:UNK Home sweet home love it ...only wish is more hot water for showers other than that it's a great place to live
UNK:UNK I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.
UNK:UNK They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you don't have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!
UNK:UNK i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.
UNK:UNK Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!
UNK:UNK Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue. Ingredients are local and super-fantastic. Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork, buy it immediately. Don't miss the rice pudding.
UNK:UNK Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend.
UNK:UNK Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza. Today my friend & I decided to try the sandwiches. Very disappointing! I had the Roast Beef & my friend had the Turkey. Both were lackluster and smothered with slimy roasted red peppers. If you go to Humble Pie, go for the pizza (and the Happy Hour!)
UNK:UNK I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
UNK:UNK Was super annoyed by this Sephora. The first three times I was asked if I was "doing ok?" was not bothersome. By the tenth time I was asked, I really felt like the employees were going to frisk me. I had a baby with me! I really hope I don't have to do any holiday shopping here. I'd rather go somewhere else.
UNK:UNK Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
UNK:UNK This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this "fast" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!
UNK:UNK Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.
UNK:UNK great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular
UNK:UNK This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner.   This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.
UNK:UNK Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice.
UNK:UNK I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?
UNK:UNK I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
UNK:UNK Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.
UNK:UNK Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
UNK:UNK Ordered the pork ramen and a rainbow roll. Both were great, sushi was like every other good sushi place and pork ramen was tasty and spicey. Good service from waiter but the hostesses weren't able to keep up with everyone and forgot we were there and had us wait awhile. Other than that, experience was good and would come back.
UNK:UNK We love this restaurant. It's a family-owned place and you always feel welcome. The food is excellent, especially compared to On the Border, etc.  Order the guacamole.  A tad pricey but it's North Scottsdale, so what do we expect?
UNK:UNK The BEST of the BEST!  I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.  Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.
UNK:UNK I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet.
UNK:UNK I like these sort of "mom & pop" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!
UNK:UNK If you like beer, you'll love Papago.   They have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good.  When ever I'm in Scottsdale, I make it a point to visit them.
UNK:UNK Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back
UNK:UNK Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)
UNK:UNK Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.
UNK:UNK Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
UNK:UNK Great drinks!!!  Good atmosphere  Fantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must)  Nice people to conversate with  What is not to like?  Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)
UNK:UNK We arrived at US Egg on St. Patrick's Day at 10:00 am before the A's vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!
UNK:UNK Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!  Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!
UNK:UNK My family and I love this place. Yummy food, great service, kid friendly, rarely a wait, great prices, nice beer selection, food always comes out hot, and people around you are having a good time. The boneless chicken with raspberry barbecue sauce is so so yummy!
UNK:UNK Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didn't find anything "to die for" but it's good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didn't feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- I'm usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day.
UNK:UNK I am not a beer drinker, so this is not rating the beer, but the food and atmosphere.  1) Atmosphere: sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside  2) Food - pretty good for bar food  3) Hit it up if you are in Tempe, its just one of those places you need to go
UNK:UNK Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!
UNK:UNK The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere.
UNK:UNK Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!
UNK:UNK Scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns.  Simple, basic and just what you want for an early morning breakfast.  It's kind of like having breakfast in someone's kitchen.  I'd recommend starting with (and sharing) one of their cinnamon rolls.  They're big and covered with frosting!  Good stuff!
UNK:UNK No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out "In and Out Man I love that place" I think that says it all.
UNK:UNK a bit too sweet (sweeter than Yogurtland and Red Mango), but liked the skinny mango and blueberry flavors, excellent spread of toppings (incl. green tea mochi) and great quality fruit. perfect stop-in on Mill.
UNK:UNK Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.
UNK:UNK Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix. Crab Cake Sandwich was great!
UNK:UNK The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
UNK:UNK Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.
UNK:UNK Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!
UNK:UNK Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some!  The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home.
UNK:UNK Excellent burger
UNK:UNK Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
UNK:UNK Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it.
UNK:UNK Being a stranger to town, it took a while to find it, but well worth the search.  I was hungry for cajun food and thought I would give it a try, and am glad I did.  I tried both the gumbo and jambalaya and both were excellent.  I sat at the bar, and the service was friendly and attentive. Although it is a long drive, I will be going back as soon as I have another craving for cajun food.
UNK:UNK Very nice, classy decor all around, cleaner than most places I've seen. Seems like a place you'd wanna dress up for.  Drinks could be a little cheaper ($9 a shot), but I figure it's Scottsdale, so whatevs..  Music ranges anywhere from old school hip hop to top 40's music you hear straight from the radio.  No cover, so that's always a plus.
UNK:UNK Great soup at a great price.  I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.  Service could be a little quicker.  Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.
UNK:UNK Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!
UNK:UNK Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.
UNK:UNK I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.
UNK:UNK This is a great staple of Tempe.  I try to stop by here before spring training and Diamondback games.  If you're looking for a grill dog I would say this is the place to go.
UNK:UNK I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.
UNK:UNK Great cleaners, open weird hours, always polite to me, anyhoo.
UNK:UNK It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.
UNK:UNK Bad customer service!    No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(
UNK:UNK What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.  $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.
UNK:UNK Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating.
UNK:UNK I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here.
UNK:UNK Good water pressure.  $2 = 6 min. Cons- "water pressure gun" rubber tips come OFF -can scratch car paint. Had to back out since a car blocked me forward-then a hose (which I put back) caught my car. Hispanc guy gets angry/curses. The ceiling 360 degress brush holder gets jammed. 1 is bent. Stalls get muddy.  Vacuums not strong.
UNK:UNK I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right.
UNK:UNK Five stars, five 1st  star Culinary excellence, 2nd star Service perfection 3rd star Atmosphere and history 4th star flawless operation  5th star dessert -1 star, management need not say more.,    Old School Style fine dinning.  This restaurant dates way back to the early days of downtown Phoenix.
UNK:UNK The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!
UNK:UNK After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.
UNK:UNK Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family! We ordered the Rocky's Philly Steak Pizza along with a cheese pizza and both were delicious! Everyone left happy.
UNK:UNK In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.
UNK:UNK = = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =  After having enjoyed this nice 3-Star place which we regulars called "Eastern Buffet & Tacky Swapmeet" for over two years, I was sad to come up here today & find them gone.     :-(  For a similar place nearby I went to New China Buffet today, & enjoyed it.  They're at 2939 N 24th St.
UNK:UNK Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
UNK:UNK This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to. The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help. The other day, I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas.
UNK:UNK This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.
UNK:UNK I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)
UNK:UNK 35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
UNK:UNK Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the 'lounge'...just say no! Trust me... Artichoke brushetta is good but garlicky which I like
UNK:UNK Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!
UNK:UNK So I started this review over a month ago, and I still can't get the Duck Breast Tacos out of my mind.  I don't remember much else at this point, except I got the Lazy Enchiladas and they were great too. But M got the aforementioned tacos, and their tender smoky goodness haunts me.  I need to go back as soon as M gets home.
UNK:UNK This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!
UNK:UNK This was another stop on our pub crawl and I only had one drink here so I don't have too much to go by for rating, but they had a nice selection and the cider realler hit the spot.  They had a nice big patio outside that accomodated a ton of us and when the birthday boy was ready to leave, the waitress tallied everything up nice and quick.
UNK:UNK Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
UNK:UNK Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service!   Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!
UNK:UNK came out last night with a few friends. The bar was cool, but I'm really not a fan of the crowd in Old Town. The drink prices were not bad, but it was a blast dancing outside. Overall a pretty cool spot.
UNK:UNK I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :)
UNK:UNK Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
UNK:UNK Sit at the bar, order tacos and sangria. you will not be disappointed.*  *you might be disappointed if you do not like techno music and a wide variety of alternative relationships being showcased around you. If you like to eat/drink and have a little social interaction and have an open mind, then this place is for you.
UNK:UNK You know......first when my girl dragged me here....i thought it will suck. Once I stepped in....well....BAM! Interesting colors fill my senses. I do appreciate the set up of this place and the quirky items I found. So yea it is a chick store but still managed to entertain me.
UNK:UNK I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
UNK:UNK Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!
UNK:UNK Years ago, and I do mean years ago, their Mill Avenue location in Tempe, was outstanding.  As they expanded, the food along with the total expierence has gone DOWNHILL, big time. Why has this happened ... they're doing franchising.    I'm suggesting a name change: "My Big Fat Greek Disappoinment"
UNK:UNK The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the "Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining" - older and almost antiquated.
UNK:UNK Not impressed. The young lady behind the counter aked like she could care less about my 15 shirts I had to drop off. I had used them before and nobody ever smiles at you. When I asked about pricing and how they protect shrinkage she said " we can't guarantee anything". Well, I can guarantee I will be goping elsewhere. You would think based on how expensive they are that they would care more.
UNK:UNK The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well.
UNK:UNK I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
UNK:UNK I tried the shrimp and chips and they were tasty.  The shrimp was a little salty, but with the dipping sauce they tasted fine.  I liked the "chips" a lot.  After reading the other review I'm nervous to try the fish and chips.
UNK:UNK I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering.  Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!
UNK:UNK 3/5  the sandwiches are huge. i'm not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs.
UNK:UNK I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
UNK:UNK Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
UNK:UNK Had a very delightful meal here the other day.  I benchmark all Chinese restaurants by their potstickers.  These were delicious and not deep fried.  They were more toasted than anything.  The mongolian beef was delicious.  Good quality, nice spicy flavor.
UNK:UNK Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.
UNK:UNK Nice spot, with a friendly staff.  The sandwiches were very good, and the ingredients all tasted very fresh.  The lady at the counter convinced me to try the cookies, and I was not disappointed.  Oh, and of course, try the cider, it's no joke. Mmmm.
UNK:UNK As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
UNK:UNK Love, love, love! Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect. The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing. I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu, and it was all delicious. This is my fave place in the country right now. Can't wait to go back over the holidays!
UNK:UNK My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!
UNK:UNK The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.  I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.
UNK:UNK Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable.
UNK:UNK I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.
UNK:UNK This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or two's first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it ain't broke- don't order something else.).  Had a great night!
UNK:UNK I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when a friend suggested we meet there I was all for it. Easy to see furniture store Big Bronco and Janey's is behind it. Very good coffee and I'll come back to try the food.  Comfortable place to just hang out.
UNK:UNK This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.
UNK:UNK Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.  Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted.
UNK:UNK Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.
UNK:UNK Surprised to have a good sushi place like this in Fountain Hills.  Can get expensive, but eat in or take out is always great.  Fun to mingle with the chef while making the sushi.
UNK:UNK Excellent service.  Easy to access.  Dessert is amazing.  Husband loved Salted Butter gelato, I loved the cherry.  he always loves his fish entrees here.  I eat very unsophisticated so finding anything here on the menu is hard for me.  I tried a pasta last night, it was salty and boring.   I still recommend this place for people with grown up tastes.
UNK:UNK We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.  If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot.
UNK:UNK The food here is amazing! So full of flavor, not fat. Healthy, and delicious!  Prices in the 10 range for a salad, and 20 range for an entree'.  The resturant is very loud, because they are always busy. The chairs are too small for my hips, making it uncomfortable to stay very long.  Oh well. I suppose they expect, if you eat here, you must be a size 6.
UNK:UNK I'm on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty.
UNK:UNK I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me.   I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
UNK:UNK I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.
UNK:UNK This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0)
UNK:UNK Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?
UNK:UNK Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.  Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.
UNK:UNK Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation.
UNK:UNK LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.
UNK:UNK The grilled yellow tail salmon here is out of this world! I have eaten here twice in last 8 weeks and the sushi is fresh. The miso soup is great. Everything I have tried has been delicious. The staff is fairly friendly. Looking forward to happy hour here in the near future.
UNK:UNK The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great.
UNK:UNK Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.   " wine tasting director" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D
UNK:UNK Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?
UNK:UNK Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!
UNK:UNK Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.
UNK:UNK The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.  The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.
UNK:UNK Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area.
UNK:UNK The place is nothing special, you can even think there is nothing going on there as it is almost hidden. Once you are in, you still won't believe there is something worthy. Sit and try one of their gyros, hummus or the vegetarian combo! All tasty and well served. After that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time!
UNK:UNK Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)
UNK:UNK I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there.
UNK:UNK Formerly Sandbar, this is a great new spot in Central Scottsdale to chill out after work. Good Mexican food, good strong drinks, and a massive outdoor patio with pleanty of drinking activities. They also have plenty of TVs to watch the big game. FYI - It gets slammed on weekend nights...
UNK:UNK Returned for another meal and the overall experience was excellent. Only negative was that the braised leak appetizer is now somewhat drenched in cheese.. Feels a bit "pizza hut".
UNK:UNK Don't waste your time...Arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better!
UNK:UNK Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
UNK:UNK Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
UNK:UNK Tried Ling & Louies for the first time, different than the traditional for sure. Service and food were both excellent. We tried the duck sliders,lucky lo mein rice, orange peel chicken & beef & broccoli.
UNK:UNK I had a chicken panini and was more than enough! It was dinner and lunch!  They have this special bread that is like a big bun. The people is very friendly and patient to explain their different options. Nice place, and for sandwiches it was just good.
UNK:UNK Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service.
UNK:UNK I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)  So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.
UNK:UNK Food and atmosphere, it's excellent for me. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, my husband is generally picky and only praises the American comfort foods but this time , he liked it a lot. We ordered red chicken curry and two thumbs up! I cant wait to dine in at that place again. Winner!
UNK:UNK I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.
UNK:UNK This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
UNK:UNK As much as you don't want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!
UNK:UNK Very good food! We ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese. They split our tacos up for us and didn't charge for it...the portions were great too!  Our server was friendly as well. Would definitely return!
UNK:UNK I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all.  Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. I'm not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank.  Fair warning.
UNK:UNK GREAT customer service!  Bought a compromised food item and they assured me that this issue would be corrected immediately.   Plus they insisted on comping me the BEST MEDJOOL dates I have ever ever tasted.  I had been happy to pay $7 per pound for them because they are utterly superior when purchasing them before.
UNK:UNK Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!  My local Fry's is going through a revamp and now I have no idea where anything is. It's just momentary inconvenience- I will find my bearings again and appreciate the improvements!
UNK:UNK I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!
UNK:UNK Our second experience here was much better. We knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options. We had:  - Mussels appetizer  - Stuffed mushrooms appetizer  - Chicken flatbread  - Salmon  - Scallops  Everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!
UNK:UNK Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, "I need to stop there." Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!
UNK:UNK I think Fate is delicious and great! I love the remodeled house the restaurant is in....super cute! Fate's crab puffs are simply amazing,filled with cream cheese and crab goodness!  The hong kong flat rice noodles are scrumptious! The sauce on the flat rice noodles is SO flavorful, I could  eat them all day! I don't get all of the bad reviews on Fate. I think those people are simply crazy!
UNK:UNK I only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place. My cousin is 4 years old and obsessed with trains so he loves the small train display, the stationary trains you can walk through and the little train that goes around the park that you can ride on. A definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains.
UNK:UNK Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
UNK:UNK I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience
UNK:UNK Great atmosphere with interesting lights (look like white jellyfish). Got a Chicken piccata which was delicious. TVs were conveniently placed so we were able to watch the World Series Games. Overall, a fun place to catch up with friends.
UNK:UNK Service was great, Food was excellent...the down side was the tables were dirty! The place only had one table in use when we arrived!
UNK:UNK Not bad, but not great.  Service was really friendly, and prompt.  Food was "meh", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.
UNK:UNK This is probably one of my favorite spots in Oldtown.  I definitely enjoy the the Thai food here and plus the atmosphere is really chill and homey.  Service was never a problem here every time I go.  My favorite is the Basil Crispy CK....so simple to make but I love it.  Date place? Sure why not :)
UNK:UNK Friendly, knowlegeable, GREAT coffee, cute place where you can everything from meetings to weddings, take a yoga class, and meet great people on Monday nights for Leashes and Lattes!
UNK:UNK Great for Saints and LSU games.
UNK:UNK My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!
UNK:UNK We stopped here on our way back from Wildlife World Zoo after seeing they changed the restaurant there and it doesn't have very good reviews. This was a great alternative. Plenty of food and a nice variety. I enjoyed it.
UNK:UNK Good place to go if you're hungry and don't want to cook breakfast.  Not great due to the fact that most of their food is straight from the freezer to the frying pan and just so-so.  Small portions of bland food.  Great people and great service.  Just altogether blah food.
UNK:UNK A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
UNK:UNK When I called to place an order last night I was put on hold briefly, however, this time my call was actually answered!!!!  When I walked in, the one girl at the desk seemed somewhat awake!!!  Keep up the good work Cantina Laredo!  My queso and guac were delicious!!!
UNK:UNK Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
UNK:UNK I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says "yeah, that's extra cheese", I won't be going back. Sorry.
UNK:UNK Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.
UNK:UNK We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
UNK:UNK Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the "smart" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!
UNK:UNK Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven.   The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting.  Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.
UNK:UNK Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!
UNK:UNK I went again on Friday and YUM!  I got the same ginger chicken and it was just as delicious as before.  I need to venture out and try something else on the menu.
UNK:UNK I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.
UNK:UNK Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'  This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.
UNK:UNK Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
UNK:UNK Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.
UNK:UNK oh my, these are huge gyros.  somewhat scary looking at first.  not pressed in their cellar but good enough to find on a food cart in nyc.  simply can not beat the value if you are hungry for lunch.  they do need some greek coffee though.  with all the i heart chicago wallpaper, you'd think they would have a plasma TV with my big fat greek wedding on repeat play,
UNK:UNK Went here because of the reviews on Yelp,  very good.   Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top.   Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so I'll go back and try a few different things.
UNK:UNK Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating.
UNK:UNK Nic-nacs galore!
UNK:UNK This was a very nice place to take your mother.  We both had a good lunch.  The service and iced tea were very good.  I felt like the food was high quality, but maby should have been priced 1 or 2 dollars less.  The patio was beautiful and very peaceful to visit with your lunch partner aka Mom.
UNK:UNK Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!
UNK:UNK I so wish you could do 3 1/2 stars.  i would give it.   Not bad chinese.  NYC style.  If you have lived in or around NYC you would completely understand.  I LOVE the Fried Dumplings.  SO GOOD!!  Highly recommend them.  Pork Lomein is good to.   Take out for sure.  Not really a place to sit and eat.  you can do it but it is more geared for take out.
UNK:UNK Starbucks is Starbucks when it comes to the coffee and food, but the staff at this location are particularly helpful and nice. One offered to help me decide on what drink to choose, and promised that if I did not like it, he would make me another one free of charge. The seating is a bit limited because the place is somewhat small, but other than that, an above average cookie cutter Starbucks.
UNK:UNK I had the Potato Balls, they were larger than i expected (i'm used to the likes of Portos) but i was not discouraged from attempting to take them in all at once, alas i failed.. but i was a happy camper.
UNK:UNK Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.
UNK:UNK A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy.
UNK:UNK Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.
UNK:UNK Love shopping here! It's pricey, so I don't do my regular grocery shopping at this place, but it has a lot of unique, gourmet options. It's a fun splurge!
UNK:UNK Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!
UNK:UNK cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You
UNK:UNK Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.
UNK:UNK Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-))  Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19
UNK:UNK Their beef gyro's are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good too.  Not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus, we got like one piece of pita.  Just didn't seem to be much there.  We always do carryout, and either the bartender is really nice and funny, or just werent very friendly.
UNK:UNK Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.
UNK:UNK If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better.
UNK:UNK If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
UNK:UNK Best donuts I have ever had.
UNK:UNK I really wasn't impressed with the service or the food.
UNK:UNK Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!
UNK:UNK Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check. Burgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check. Great fries- 2 kinds no less? Check.  This is a tweener restaurant-perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between.  Enjoy.
UNK:UNK I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new "brow lady" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!
UNK:UNK No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream?   Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location.
UNK:UNK good selection, they had pretty good prices too
UNK:UNK So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.
UNK:UNK What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.
UNK:UNK eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.
UNK:UNK I love this place!! Great food and service..portions are Hugh..
UNK:UNK There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
UNK:UNK Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...
UNK:UNK Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.  Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.
UNK:UNK The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
UNK:UNK Writing my 7/29/11 review prompted me to return to this establishment for a manicure. I got there at 9am, but unfortunately the sign on the door states they don't open until 10am. So I ran a few errands and returned at 10am. There was no one in the store and all the lights were out. Again, it is already over 100 degrees outside by 10am. I decided I didn't need a manicure that bad and left.
UNK:UNK I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!
UNK:UNK Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
UNK:UNK I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.  The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.
UNK:UNK I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.
UNK:UNK Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
UNK:UNK I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said.
UNK:UNK Way too expensive for a hot dog.  Confusing to eat there too unless you can speak Spanish.  Last time I checked I wasn't in Mexico.
UNK:UNK So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though.
UNK:UNK The food was what one would expect from the outside. Mel's is not a hole in the wall place with amazing food. It's diner with decent food for decent prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. It's nearby so I go. Sadly they had no T-shirts for sale.  One would think that they would capitalize off the TV history.
UNK:UNK I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;(
UNK:UNK This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
UNK:UNK great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
UNK:UNK Good Starbucks in the Happy Valley Shopping Center.  Excellent AC in this place and a nice place to cool off from the heat and get a Frap!
UNK:UNK #26, #1, #150 is my favorite. I go here every time I need something warm in my belly. They are open early too!  I love this place and the dining area has gotten bigger :)  Had the Bun bo hue. Was pretty good and cheap!
UNK:UNK Older clientele (don't go here for a hip salon) but solid professionals who know how to cut hair without messing it up :)   Thought it was a little weird getting water in a ceramic coffee mug...I think plastic cups or water bottles would be better.
UNK:UNK TORTILLA SOUP = not the biz.  that's all I tasted so that's all I'm rating this place on lol
UNK:UNK Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.  Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....
UNK:UNK The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.
UNK:UNK Best Chai Latte- Great atmosphere and friendly staff
UNK:UNK I agree with Tracy, my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's. Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley. The service is great and the food is delicious. Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area, but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.
UNK:UNK Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery, but think again!   SIt outside on the small patio area, ck out the GR8 crepes! savory, breakfasty, sweet - u pick or choose!  Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.   I luv the chicken, aspargus, basil, feta :-)   Mmmmmmmm.
UNK:UNK Tasty food, great deals at happy hour..
UNK:UNK A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.
UNK:UNK The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas. The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)
UNK:UNK My daughter and I had a couple of the beef and lamb gyros.  They were wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy,  the bread was soft and pliable.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tazeki sauce could have used some more spices, it was kind of blah.  We would go back.  Service was great too.
UNK:UNK This place always pleases! Their sandwiches are always great, bread is great, pizza is AWESOME, and their short ribs are great. The food is SO fresh! The waiters are kind and friendly. When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream, she kindly told us the freezer broke. I heart the deli!
UNK:UNK The best fast food Mexican I have had in town, complete with super cold Mexican sodas on ice. I had a barbacoa, lengua, tripita and chicharon taco.  2 hours later and I am still full, and haven't made a made clenching dash to the bathroom yet, so I'd say it was a good meal.  The chicharon was delicious, like a taco full of bacon!!!
UNK:UNK Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
UNK:UNK Went by this morning to grab a few donuts.  The real star was the glazed cinnamon twist; pretty perfect if you ask me.  Also had a chocolate glazed cruller and an old fashioned donut (I think they might be sour cream).  GET THE CINNAMON TWIST!
UNK:UNK Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
UNK:UNK Consistency is an issue with the Chipotle chain. Some of their restaurants are clean and well run, some are not.  They really need to trim the chicken of the chewy parts before they chop it up and throw it in a burrito.  That really sucks.
UNK:UNK Great for young kids... tons to do and see
UNK:UNK Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse.
UNK:UNK Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.
UNK:UNK I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
UNK:UNK No good
UNK:UNK Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????
UNK:UNK Pretty good food,  the selection was great the service was a bit slow and I had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok, all day every day 99 cent margaritas.
UNK:UNK great merch. great prices.   although..it's a bit sketchy getting out of the parking lot. you have to back up in a major street. is there anywhere else to park?
UNK:UNK Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!
UNK:UNK Great prices with great selection. Great for your everyday shopping needs.
UNK:UNK I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice. For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)
UNK:UNK Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
UNK:UNK Pleasantly surprised, great drink specials and cute outdoor seating. Food was really good and I look forward to going back!
UNK:UNK Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment.
UNK:UNK Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!
UNK:UNK Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
UNK:UNK Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
UNK:UNK The Choice Hotel chain continues to be my preferred properties of the mid-$ range hotels.  The only issue I had with this one was the noisy A/C unit in the hallway right outside the door.  Other than that, it was clean with a friendly staff.
UNK:UNK Still solid, still delicious. I love this place!
UNK:UNK Third stay here in two years.  It's o.k. But nothing terribly special.    Pros Spacious rooms Bathrooms are nice Breakfast selection  Cons Paid internet A/C is loud and blower is in bedroom part of suite Long walk to room
UNK:UNK Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...
UNK:UNK Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but it's kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)
UNK:UNK YUM! The flavors were great! Oatmeal cookie and caramel apple were great and tasted just like the real thing. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because some of the toppings such as the twinkies and baklava were whole pieces and I wish I could have just grabbed pieces of them instead of a whole one...toppings like those could add a lot of $$ very quickly so I skipped those ones.
UNK:UNK Innovative venue. Bleacher seating in the back is a bit odd, but it works. Dig the long bar at the far end of the hall. Excellent sound. Haven't tried the food yet, but I intend to investigate.
UNK:UNK Wanted a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel so picked this one.  Was ok:  Nothing major to complain about, but also really nothing to rave about either.  There are better restaurants to choose from.
UNK:UNK Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable. They Say Nothing But good things
UNK:UNK Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.    Hooray for pleasing the parents!!
UNK:UNK i dunno what the deal is...but i was not terribly impressed with the pretzel fondue. the food was actually nothing to write home about. however...the adult beverages were superb! bacon infused bloody mary? hell yes! if you're a gin fan (and i am) then you must try velvet death. that's it, end of review.
UNK:UNK This place is where I normally go to get all the different loose teas that I love to drink.  They always have at least two or more samples of their 'tea of the day' which are both hot and cold.  The best part about this place is that you can mix different teas together to create your own special blend.  I also bought a cast iron tea pot set that I absolutely adore.
UNK:UNK Who doesn't like a good carne asada burrito? No one doesn't that's who. It's rudunk
UNK:UNK I love Target.  This is a great one. Parking is decent and it's right at Desert Ridge next to everything else so it's a convienent location.
UNK:UNK This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!
UNK:UNK Sure, I'll pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I don't remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty.
UNK:UNK WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!
UNK:UNK Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales.
UNK:UNK Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
UNK:UNK INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!
UNK:UNK Pretty clean dining room and clean men's room,   friendly service,   as good as any quick serve restaurant.
UNK:UNK The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
UNK:UNK I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.
UNK:UNK No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.
UNK:UNK Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but it's definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great.
UNK:UNK NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.
UNK:UNK Great tasting frozen yogurt, excellent customer service, very clean inside. Healthy choice for a sweet treat.
UNK:UNK If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
UNK:UNK This weekend was my first time back since they have done the huge remodel and under new ownership. This place still has the same comfort feel to it and is cozy. Havent tried the food yet but enjoyed the drinks and the ambience in the bar. Hopefully the food is better than what it used to be.
UNK:UNK I go here often. This is my kind of place for a leisurely coffee and roll. Big, open, airy, warm atmosphere. Only downside is it gets too crowded. So find your own place for coffee, this is mine!
UNK:UNK So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
UNK:UNK Good & fast food. Prices are fair. They charge a fee for Bank cards.
UNK:UNK I took my son who has been living in Sweden to Angels since he likes good beer.  And he was noy disappointed.  The price was right for the quality of the beer.  We also enjoyed the food I had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great.  He loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap.  Definitely going again especially if all three of my son's are home.   Good beer good food good people
UNK:UNK Great mall. has pretty much everything.
UNK:UNK The customer service here could be 100% better but then again not much around here is anywhere near the greatness of texas customer service!!  Was not greeted when walking in and waiting for about 25 minutes!
UNK:UNK My goodness this place has gone downhill. Yeesh.
UNK:UNK I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.
UNK:UNK There food is pretty good here but they have a lot of different brews, I tried a pumpkin beer witch was very good. This place used to be real quite and unnotice now it's always busy and very crowded. It is located away from mill ave by about 3 miles so if your trying to bar hop make sure you have a dd and stop by this place.
UNK:UNK Been to a few different locations and this one by far is the best one. The food seems better than the others.
UNK:UNK Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.   This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.
UNK:UNK The Parlor is one of my go to favorites when I'm craving pizza, going on a first date or have friends and family in town.   I always have a serious conflict between the margarita pizza v. the pesto pizza. They are both sooo good. Lately I've been going for the margarita with a side of marinara side. Usually pair it with caesar salad.
UNK:UNK What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (I'm no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.
UNK:UNK I only did layovers in this airport to and from Colorado from California, but I liked it. There were a ton of places to eat which was fantastic. Their flights left on time, which was kinda annoying when we got in 10 minutes late and ended up getting stuck there for almost 3 hours. Free internet access helped with that though. It's an airport I don't mind being stuck in for a bit.
UNK:UNK Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!
UNK:UNK Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ. Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!  It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a "mall" restaurant. A MUST go!
UNK:UNK Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!
UNK:UNK This place has decent, prompt sandwiches, and I'll take it any day over every other sandwich chain in the Valley.
UNK:UNK What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.  What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it.
UNK:UNK Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!
UNK:UNK Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.   The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.  *****UPDATE*****  Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....
UNK:UNK I went for lunch with my mother-in-law, she had the veggie fajitas, and I had a chicken burro with green enchilada sauce. we both enjoyed our meals.
UNK:UNK Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
UNK:UNK Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...
UNK:UNK Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a "make-over" soon though... it's getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)
UNK:UNK The best bar in town.
UNK:UNK LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience outside! Love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights.  I went there for the first time last night 15min before close and I dont know if they usually have music or not..but if they don't, they need it.   Food was great but nothing to die for.
UNK:UNK I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.
UNK:UNK Ordered spanikopita and Greek salad. Spanny was doughy and Greek salad lacked a kick. Unlike any Greek I'd had before. Not going back.
UNK:UNK What a cool store! the wife and I spent 3 hours poking around here, ended up ordering their "cat mapper" recliner (my new throne!). I don't hunt anymore and rarely have time to fish, but I still love this store!
UNK:UNK Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang, their AC feels good here.
UNK:UNK This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
UNK:UNK On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.
UNK:UNK Yum best donuts in Phoenix.
UNK:UNK The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for "breakfast desert"!  Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms weren't clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???
UNK:UNK Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
UNK:UNK Nasty workers and over priced trash
UNK:UNK Went there to photograph a concert. Great crowd and fun quirky locals. Loved the dive bar ambience without being trashy/dirty. The lighting for the show wasn't great but the sound was good. Great beers, too. Get the 99Shillings.
UNK:UNK Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!
UNK:UNK Surprised by unexpected North Phoenix location.  Attentive but not bothersome service. Antipasto platter shared among 3 people plenty for all.  The Chianti was splendid! The entre arrived piping hot, very impressive.  The food was delicious.  Lovely intimate dining. Reccommend.  Only down side was it became so dim, had a hard time reading menu.  A bit more uplighting, please.
UNK:UNK Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!
UNK:UNK The best gluten free pizza!! Absolutely loved the avacado pizza. So delicious. The wait staff was great, very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.  Parking is limited, but certainly not an issue to complain about.
UNK:UNK Food is good.  Service is pretty good.  Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there.  Definitely will go back.
UNK:UNK The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
UNK:UNK I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!
UNK:UNK Great service by Angela and their Doc First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact Very enjoyable experience and very quick Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away Definitely recommend
UNK:UNK I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one o'clock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I don't have more to report because I was drunk and don't remember much else, so that tells you it must be good.
UNK:UNK Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full.
UNK:UNK = = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =  China Star here has now closed.     :-(
UNK:UNK I love that Goober will deliver direct to your door!!  The are affordable, convenient and include free bones with your order.  The only reason why I do not rate them as a 5 star is that several times they have had to call me to let me know they are out of a product I ordered online.
UNK:UNK Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
UNK:UNK Met a group of people...great craft beer selection.. ordered Old World Salad w/House Dressing, excellent.. enough to feed 2-4 people.. then the Murphy pizza.. applewood smoked bacon and onions w/the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various  pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us..
UNK:UNK Tasty standard bar food. Great bar service. Sweet servers (90% of the time). Huge awesome patio.  The cherry on top is that it is NOT on mill ave!  Best spot to be at on a beautiful spring afternoon in Arizona.  What else could you possibly need?
UNK:UNK All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.    ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.
UNK:UNK Coach house is your favorite dive bar...this bar reminds me of almost every shit hole in the upper peninsula of Michigan. A great little spot to throw back a few beers after a rough day.  Drinks are cheap and the staff is friendly. Plenty of games to play and TV's to watch.  If you have never been I would definitely check it out.
UNK:UNK I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of D&B's food. Typically if I'm here it's to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, it's a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you can't beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)
UNK:UNK I had a serious craving for Roti.  So glad I found this place.  A very small menu selection but it had exactly what I wanted.  The serving for $8.20 after tax is enough for 2 meals.  I know where to go from now on for a great meal with leftovers.  This is a noteworthy place to bring my Uncle T.J. who's a Trini when he comes to visit.
UNK:UNK This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG. Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.
UNK:UNK Older restrant but very good food
UNK:UNK I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.  Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.  Also, the potato salad is fantastic!
UNK:UNK Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
UNK:UNK Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.
UNK:UNK One of those places that can not possibly serve bad food...! Lunch, specifically, is very nice, quick and affordable... All their curries as well as entrees are equally good and you can ogfcourse adjust the level of spice as in all Thai places... ( that's something I don't like but serves good for those who don't eat spicy food)... Thai coffee is one of my favourites too...
UNK:UNK I have always loved this place.   Good Food, fair price,  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.  All around good place..   its a go to .
UNK:UNK probably my favorite restaurant :)
UNK:UNK This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
UNK:UNK This would be a  great place to live at
UNK:UNK I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.
UNK:UNK Been parking here at least 10 times; fast, affordable and safe.  Use your smartphone and YELP app to access the super check-in discount.  While it didn't happen this time, at Christmas they were especially full, so don't be surprised at that time of year and make reservations (yes, make reservations at a parking lot)
UNK:UNK This Pei Wei is consistant with it's orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I don't see that happening but a girl can wish can't she?
UNK:UNK Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.
UNK:UNK Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!
UNK:UNK I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.    Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!
UNK:UNK I really enjoy the food here. Great breakfast fare. Great prices. Great service. The pancakes are really good. I still wonder why people go to Dennys.  This is wayyyyyy better.
UNK:UNK I didn't give this rating based on taste because I frankly hate Pizza Hut pizza. I think it's gross. The sandwiches and wings are great though. My fiance loves it all though. I like it because it is right next to our house and the staff are always friendly. I pick it up on my way home and if I get there early they try to get it for me as soon as they can.
UNK:UNK I've been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friend's "go-to" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if you're not in a hurry it's no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!
UNK:UNK Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more can you ask for. The satff was friendly and fast, Cant wait to try it again.
UNK:UNK Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!  The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!
UNK:UNK Great Happy Hour ! Great Food ! I work in the building and many of us wish they opened for lunch.
UNK:UNK Id say 3 stars but since the have menudo everyday and prepare it at order I'll go 4. Street tacos are good so is the carne asada.  Typical gringo "Mexican" food.
UNK:UNK Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
UNK:UNK I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!
UNK:UNK Had just gotten off a long flight and wondered into Aunt Chiladas for the first time.  Loved the food and the margaritas !!  Will go back again.
UNK:UNK The place was dope! The only bummer was the half-assed sun cover offerings out on the patio, but we were lucky to find a spot inside for post brunch drinks! Food, service and atmosphere are all good! Definitely make it to this spot!
UNK:UNK Cheap and good, family type feel...
UNK:UNK This was my first restaurant in Phoenix. I was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview I had. I was pretty nervous about the whole situation so I don't remember too many details, but I would recommend this place if you're a sushi lover or on the go and need a quick lunch to eat at your desk. Service was great too.
UNK:UNK This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).  The service is always really good.  Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.  One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!  Great place to come after a movie at Harkins.
UNK:UNK Sorry, had to deduct a star because it's freakin EXPENSIVE for lawn seats. Really Glendale? You're gonna charge $13 for lawn seats?   It's a BEAUTIFUL facility! Plenty of grass, plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and a plethora of food choices... all which perfectly align with the baseball experience.
UNK:UNK Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!
UNK:UNK We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
UNK:UNK Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.
UNK:UNK Very casual.    Great white alfredo pizza.  We get it with mushrooms, onions and ricotta.  So yum!  Very pleasant staff.  Delivery - quick!  Salads are just okay.  Standard - w/ iceburge lettuce  It's really for the pizza that we go.
UNK:UNK Great food with family!  Good place to laugh and watch a game or two.
UNK:UNK What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended.
UNK:UNK My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, I'm sure it's worth it!
UNK:UNK Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
UNK:UNK This place is an amazing little find. It serves fresh, delicious noodles for next to nothing. The absolute best part of this place is that you get to pick the kind of noodle you want meaning you can try your favorite dish multiple times while changing it up!
UNK:UNK Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back.
UNK:UNK Same as the others...   Clean, friendly and good.   I was able to order a chicken legs and mashed taters for one kid, coleslaw and frys for the other, 2 kids meals for the adults and no one complained. They are always more then happy to help you in anyway possible.
UNK:UNK Byblos has some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever tasted. Their falafels and Tzatziki are delicious. And the restaurant serves up an amazing tomato cream soup which will have you lapping up every last bite. This is a great lunchtime destination.
UNK:UNK Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!
UNK:UNK One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
UNK:UNK It's Baja Fresh, what can i say? It's clean, they're fast and it's a hell of a lot better than McDonald's. I usually call in my lunch order from work and it's almost always ready and waiting when I get there to pick it up.  I do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and I could probably live on just that for the rest of my life. I get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself.
UNK:UNK I'm not a big fan of this place.  I hate these "centers" where you have to park in a parking garage and pay to park.  I'm already paying to go the shops and restaraunts, why do I need to pay to park too?  Seems stupid and not a good way to get peopel to frequent your business.  I'd rather go to Desert Ridge, Tempe Marketplace or any other one.
UNK:UNK Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys! They make their own bread onsite, which is to die for! Love it. Hate the valet parking.
UNK:UNK Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate.
UNK:UNK Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special, not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!  I'll definitely be returning :)
UNK:UNK The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back
UNK:UNK I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.
UNK:UNK I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
UNK:UNK The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!
UNK:UNK By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck.   Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.
UNK:UNK This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
UNK:UNK Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street.  Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant. My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious.  I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )
UNK:UNK This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
UNK:UNK My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!
UNK:UNK Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
UNK:UNK Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.
UNK:UNK This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone.
UNK:UNK Best Steak Ever. That is all.    Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now.
UNK:UNK It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down.
UNK:UNK So much food to choose from on the menu! They have so many options (healthy eater,unhealthy eater,  vegetarian, breakfast, lunch, etc)  for every kind of diner. I tried an omlet with turkey and brie and I enjoyed it very much. The orange juice was fresh. I was expecting very large portions but they are more than perfect for a super hungry appetite. Service was very good.
UNK:UNK the grilled chicken sandwich hold the mayo add ketchup and mustard and the fries - off the chain!  minus one star because it should stay open later.
UNK:UNK Went downhill. Not clean and the food isn't what it used to be.
UNK:UNK This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere. It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait? Yeah,I'm done here.
UNK:UNK great beer, great food, great prices and it's haunted!!!
UNK:UNK Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.
UNK:UNK I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her...
UNK:UNK I start at 40th st and Shea and I love this hike! This hike is HARD. I call it a sleeper hike, it starts off easy and then before you know it...BAM....it get's a little ridiculous. It will kick your butt but it's totally worth it.
UNK:UNK This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)
UNK:UNK I'm not a huge sushi person (I know, I know...) but I ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy. The server was friendly and the chefs were efficient. The atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming.
UNK:UNK everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!
UNK:UNK Came here for my cousins rehersal dinner and the first dish out was the lobster bisque and it was one of the best things ive ever ate !!!!!! AMAZING, I could have ate 10 more bowls of this and forget the main dish. the main dish i got some chicken dish that i dont remember that well. I do remember that it was over pasta and the pasta was great,  I also had 2 GREAT dirty martinis ,
UNK:UNK Amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The prize of the 90 Minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact. I will be back for the shelter tour.
UNK:UNK I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little "Good Job" on Yelp!
UNK:UNK Great dive bar. Great jukebox
UNK:UNK Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar.
UNK:UNK The Corner Bakery was A-Ok! To me it seemed like an elevated Paradise/Panera. I had the Cobb Salad and it was perfectly chopped and dressed.  The desserts looked really good but a little on the pricey side for me to try that day. I'll be back because I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great customer service.
UNK:UNK The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas.  Food could be better...
UNK:UNK you want a hotel, what really matters?  Cleanliness!!!  5 stars. Friendly staff. And they got the really good cylindrical candies... mmmmm.    ok, now that we got that out of the way.... some funky odors in one of the hallways and elevator at one end of the hall was out of order our entire stay.  i would come back though.  solid price performer.
UNK:UNK If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.
UNK:UNK Well....it is what you can expect from airport food.  Not that great but not terrible.  All I wanted was a simple sandwhich to take on the plane with me.  This airport does not have the best in choices, Starbucks, Wendys, Pizza Hut, etc.  This little place is literally a kiosk in terminal C.  It is good if you are in a rush and just want something cold for later.
UNK:UNK This is a very good Chinese restaurant, we have gone there for years. I am shocked by the bad reviews and would suggest you ignore them, this is good Chinese food!
UNK:UNK took my wife there last week. it is a really good. the food was great and the decor was really cool and the staff was very helpful and  nice.
UNK:UNK I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.
UNK:UNK I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I don't need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100.
UNK:UNK I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy.
UNK:UNK Jesse and I had a lovely evening out- we had great dishes and the owner was our server as well. He belts out a lovely Italian birthday song while playing the guitar. Very nice
UNK:UNK 2.5, just not enough to give it three.   Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm!   They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!
UNK:UNK Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table.
UNK:UNK My family comes here for cases of citrus every year. The navels and tangerines are delicious, and very reasonably priced. They also have lots of other interesting local products like a variety of honeys.
UNK:UNK Careful! You'll get addicted.  Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.  The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!
UNK:UNK It was just okay for me. Pizza was huge which was great for the price. I would eat there again.... But it would not make my top 10 favorites.  It has nothing that stands out to me as a wow factor.  Wings were good.
UNK:UNK Stopped in with my two yr old granddaughter today after going to the children's museum, got some raised eyebrows when the cool people  saw the kid but whatever I had to have one of there dirty chai's. Good as usual and the kiddo had a cupcake she thoroughly enjoyed on the drive home.
UNK:UNK Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen. My feet were so dry afterwards. I DO NOT recommend them
UNK:UNK Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!
UNK:UNK One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service.   Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner.   The bar area is always DARK (how it should be).
UNK:UNK YUM!  I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
UNK:UNK Yelpers,  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting.
UNK:UNK Descent food, of course it's not autentico. Free chips, salsa, & wifi though.
UNK:UNK Scale of 1-10 (single visit): 8 Food 9 Service 9 Atmosphere 7 Value
UNK:UNK While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan.
UNK:UNK It's like Paradise Bakery but with a more diverse and far better menu.
UNK:UNK I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better.
UNK:UNK AMAZING!  This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!!  140 degree grande peppermint latte!  WOWZA!  YIPPEE!  Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didn't matter because my drink was perfect:)  FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.
UNK:UNK This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.
UNK:UNK I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.
UNK:UNK Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
UNK:UNK One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :)
UNK:UNK Stopped in and tried both their sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Much fonder of the sweet potatoes & the others were a little heavy?!   Like previous posts I was not to fond of their dipping sauces either.  Loved their freshly prepared lemonade and the great outside spot to people watch!
UNK:UNK I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.   The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.   The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
UNK:UNK Unbelievable ahi. Service was adequate.  Mood and ambiance was good. Background music was nice. Will go again sometime.
UNK:UNK Super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fast...delicious too!
UNK:UNK the broth was too sweet for me. perhaps just personal taste though.
UNK:UNK This is a beautiful store. Its huge and spacious. The workers are friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with cute, nerdy boys who help you fix things! :]
UNK:UNK Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.
UNK:UNK Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.  I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.
UNK:UNK 5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space.
UNK:UNK These guys are still delivering consistenly good, fresh food.  It's a great little neighborhood place, good food, friendly owners.  Just a really good place to go for a nice meal out - nothing fancy.  Clean restrooms - always.  Good limoncello after dinner - always a hit!
UNK:UNK Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong.   High quality furniture and very low prices.
UNK:UNK I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment.
UNK:UNK I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
UNK:UNK Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.
UNK:UNK I really like the facial I had done. I was able to choose what I wanted and I could see the results when I left. Very nice.
UNK:UNK BYOB and you can get a flaming boat of sushi?! #winning  This is an awesome neighborhood place with reasonable prices and delicious menu options. Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems.  I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun.
UNK:UNK D-scust-ing.
UNK:UNK The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).  Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!
UNK:UNK I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
UNK:UNK Clean, fast, fairly cheap.  I had the Orange chicken and it was good. Liked the brown rice option.   I enjoyed this $6.19 meal much more than the lame sandwich/soup I had at Great Grains yesterday and that cost me $12.25,  I'll be back to Tott's.
UNK:UNK Great food. Great ambiance. Great for a night date on the patio. I can't wait to go again.
UNK:UNK Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally "just in case it's gotten better", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer.
UNK:UNK I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?  Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?
UNK:UNK Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too.  The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?
UNK:UNK What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
UNK:UNK Never had any complaints about this place, except it smells like death when you walk in. I've always been well taken care of when Im here.
UNK:UNK Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
UNK:UNK Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
UNK:UNK This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome and of the good "Homemade" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now.
UNK:UNK Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.  On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.
UNK:UNK This place is absolutely delicious but you'll want to stay away on Friday and Saturday nights. It gets packed and the service declines. My boyfriend and I went a couple of weeks ago and if the food wasn't so delicious, the service would have kept us from returning. Kind of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld; you'll do whatever it takes to get what you want!
UNK:UNK More expensive than some of the other nearby locations ($5 military lot next door) The shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night. Nice enough, they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full. The boyfriend and I had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night. It also seems more secure. Loved it!
UNK:UNK The staff is friendly and will give you a smile.  The store is clean.   The plaza is very nice and a good place to shop for all kinds of things.  That said, the food is typical of a chain style and reflects my 3 rating.   I'm sure many people will enjoy the food.  I just prefer a Pollo Asado Burrito from one of the local "mom & pop" shops.   Overall, it's OK.
UNK:UNK Prices are often way too high!
UNK:UNK Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)
UNK:UNK Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.  It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.  What a deal!  Under 5. bucks including the drink.  I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.
UNK:UNK Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!
UNK:UNK I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(
UNK:UNK Great lunch buffet, for the price, you get a ton of different types of food to try.  The naan is great and piping hot.  I will say that their chicken tikki masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance, this place is super pretty and delicious!
UNK:UNK Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....
UNK:UNK Nothing spectacular about the food...service was good and the fruity adult beverages/margaritas were tasty. Somehow, between 2 people, we ended up spending close to $50. We thought the waitress was being friendly, but after ordering drinks, it seemed like all she wanted to do was sell us more random crap to get a bigger tip.  It was a nice change to see hockey on the big screen...
UNK:UNK Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.
UNK:UNK Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back.   The dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant.
UNK:UNK This place is a most see must do during xmas time! The staff is always friendly, drinks are reasonable and the place is always packed on the weekends. It is a must because of their un beatable holiday spirit. This place is top to bottom decked out with lights wrapping paper and anything shinny and colorful.
UNK:UNK What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!
UNK:UNK I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.    The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.    They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!  Enjoy
UNK:UNK Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!
UNK:UNK Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious.
UNK:UNK Stayed for a few days. Was not impressed. I prefer Marriott, but was not available. The room was clean and check in was good. The pool and fitness center sucked. I had dinner in the restaurant, a hamburger. It was good. Over all downtown Phoenix sucks, nothing to do after 6PM.
UNK:UNK Beer Selection 10/10 however service is 1/10. Staff lacks product knowledge. Specials are not mentioned. Wait time is long. Staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.
UNK:UNK Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
UNK:UNK Amazing. Romantic!
UNK:UNK Absolute greatness!!!  Service: friendly  Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this) Kung pao noodles Vegan chilli fries  Ambiance - A+  Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.   Go next door to nami for dessert!!
UNK:UNK Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.
UNK:UNK Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked.  Seared Ahi Tuna:  flavorless.  Pork sliders:  Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead.
UNK:UNK We go to Fresh Wasabi a lot and usually it's the same thing...the service is not the fastest on the planet, but when you are there with good company you hardly notice. Their sushi is amazing and they have a perfectly priced menu. Love it!
UNK:UNK Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.
UNK:UNK Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'.
UNK:UNK Good coffee and they always take care of what i need in a timely manner. Never mind the fact it is literally 20 yards from my front door, but that may play into my liking of the establishment.  Either way you should check it out and enjoy some free Wifi.
UNK:UNK I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!
UNK:UNK Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.
UNK:UNK At first I was disappointed with Padre's menu.  I usually get tacos, rice, and beans, and they only had soft tacos.  But then I ventured out and got this amazing beef burrito that came with rice and beans.  Really glad I tried it.  I was also pleased to see that they had Sol beer on the menu.  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in restaurants.
UNK:UNK Tip:  If you know how to play poker...go sit at a poker table, and order the fried rice.  You get your meal for half price while playing poker.  The filet mignon fried rice(ask for it rare and it will come out medium) is excellent!
UNK:UNK The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.
UNK:UNK This place is closed.  Good riddance.
UNK:UNK Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
UNK:UNK still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!! -- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-
UNK:UNK The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking.
UNK:UNK i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant.  2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again.  this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along.
UNK:UNK This place is right up my alley.  Smithwick's on tap- check Awesome fish & chips (award-winning for a good reason)- check Good pub vibe accompanied by live music- check A nice soccer following (the unofficial bar for Glasgow Celtic supporters- not my club, but good enough)- check  I'll go with 4 & 1/4 stars.
UNK:UNK I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously.
UNK:UNK Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto "sandwich", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!
UNK:UNK My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!
UNK:UNK Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to "enhance" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.
UNK:UNK This is now Amore Sports Grill. Try the sausage & peppers, they are to die for.
UNK:UNK ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good.
UNK:UNK Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
UNK:UNK Easily the worst "burrito" I have ever had. It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.
UNK:UNK Awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go. I ordered the habanero burger and it really lit me up. As I was nearly finished the waiter remembered it is supposed to come with a free glass of milk (which I didn't get).
UNK:UNK The hubs & I have been coming here for a couple years now. We usually hit the drive thru. Always get the same thing, butterburgers w/fries/onion rings & a concrete mixer. The employees are always super friendly & always offer our doggy a treat. Definitely our go to spot when we're in the mood for burgers & frozen custard.
UNK:UNK Love all their dishes!
UNK:UNK Pretty new building and they have a pretty good selection in books. As Steve mentioned they're pretty nice in finding you a book. They have the usual Starbucks inside which is also pretty good. (Staff is friendly and the service is great)
UNK:UNK This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.  The cost is very low - $5 per adult.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.  Also, the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.  Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central.
UNK:UNK Highest gas  prices in the valley!
UNK:UNK The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are 5 stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture.
UNK:UNK We went to Central Grille on Thanksgiving for their buffet.  Good food, excellent service and very nice ambiance.  We asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it.  Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy some food.  While I didn't drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list.  I will go back, enjoyed the experience.
UNK:UNK I agree with the other guys. The towels here are gross. Staff is not helpful. When i checked in there was no vehicles in parking lot. When I asked for a room I could park in front of because I wanted to be able to keep an eye on my truck they said none were available to me. If you don't get much business maybe you should be nice to the people who do show up.
UNK:UNK It's a hotel bar, so expect typical hotel pricing on drinks.  They have some good tapas to choose from, ask for the calamari, but a grilled version (off the menu)... it's REALLY good.  I've had a few of their drinks there, but I stick to the mojitos, but had plenty of others that were just as good.
UNK:UNK I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!
UNK:UNK Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically.   PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead.
UNK:UNK Great customer service, nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona.
UNK:UNK Friendly staff, clean restaurant, good food.  Our favourite - filet & chicken kabobs.  Patio seating with fans - great with a Blue Moon when the weather is nice.
UNK:UNK Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
UNK:UNK Great beer selecton, and the white pizza is delicious!  Good hang out spot wit sports on the big screen and board games/darts if that's your thing.    They also have a wide selection of exotic beer for sale.  This is a beer paradise!
UNK:UNK A great place for group celebrations, Fajitas serves up its signature dish in 1/2 pound increments, including chicken, beef, pork, shrimp and vegetarian. Served with sides-- lettuce, salsa, cheese, pico, etc-- and warm tortillas, the fajitas always taste great. There's little reason to stray elsewhere on the menu, other than appetizers and additional sides.
UNK:UNK I was last at this place in 2004, and it was great.  My favorite band was playing and I had a great time dancing, drinking and just listening to music.  It's a must-see for any rhythm and blues fan.  Of course, it wasn't open when I just visited.  Ah well.  But still a good place to catch a show.
UNK:UNK Great! came here with my girlfriend and my mom and left very satisfied! We ordered some of there apparently famous bruschetta, some panini and a bottle of their Zweigel wine from Austria and it was all fantastic! I highly recommend going there and at least getting some wine and bruschetta if nothing else, it is well worth you time!  Keep singing,  -Jerron
UNK:UNK i miss this place so much, it's insanity.   ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.
UNK:UNK Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!
UNK:UNK The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!
UNK:UNK If its cold, creamy ,sweet, and I can put many a topping of choice on it and its fat free and low calories, I'm all in. Golden spoon is this and more. Simply delicious flavors and all around good. Need I say more?
UNK:UNK My wife and I ate here when we were in town for the B&J auto auction.  The food was good and affordable.  We liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty Margaritas.  Staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience.
UNK:UNK Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place.
UNK:UNK Food is consistently tasty and people are way cool. Take care of your bartenders!
UNK:UNK love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey
UNK:UNK We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid.   When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!  If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!  Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.
UNK:UNK I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better.  I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.  So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
UNK:UNK I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.
UNK:UNK I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
UNK:UNK great product, cool concept and atmosphere, would get the 5th star if was more welcoming to hanging out and enjoying with a cup of coffee, but i also can respect the fact that this place is strictly business.  like any place if you get there during a rush you are gong to wait, but the trade off is fresh product neatly packaged a for sure spot to check out in old town
UNK:UNK Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect "date night" too.
UNK:UNK The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!
UNK:UNK Spectacular view and great beer on tap.  The atmosphere is one that makes you want to hang out all day and enjoy the view.
UNK:UNK Been closed for a long time.
UNK:UNK Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and "owner" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!
UNK:UNK This place is amazing! The food was delicious, the waffle was like no other.  The service was great, very attentive and nice. I will be returning.
UNK:UNK It's Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
UNK:UNK Very cool neighborhood restaurant and wine bar in North Scottsdale.  The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful and the selection was great.  The pizzas looked fantastic, so we'll be coming back to try them out!
UNK:UNK Not very impressed.  Burger was ok, fries Looked great, but mushy Try Smashburger!!  Sooo much better
UNK:UNK One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.   I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!  I eat the entire plate every time.
UNK:UNK Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.
UNK:UNK What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.
UNK:UNK Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation). It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good.  I anxious to try more items on the menu!
UNK:UNK I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.  I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux.
UNK:UNK New Taco shops seem to be opening at a fast clip and America's stands out as one of the best. We absolutely love the quesadilla and the  tacos. The corn is also a must have.   If you go with two people, don't miss their meal for two deal that includes two drinks.   We can't wait until their 7th Ave store opens in January. Hopefully the quality will stay the same.
UNK:UNK What else can I say that hasn't been said already?    I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!  My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for "more " for the first time at the store:)  I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order
UNK:UNK I heart Harkins. Have for years. Love the loyalty cups & t's.
UNK:UNK This place was never attractive to me, until it was the only place showing a good documentary I wanted to watch. Nice surprise! I only expect to see other good alternative movies here more often.
UNK:UNK Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
UNK:UNK Your typical Tempe boozatorium.  It has a generic and unmemorable name likely because the name describes everything about this place.  If you wander into it, you won't remember much more than that.
UNK:UNK No need for a long review.  Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.  Great Food Great Customer Service  Love this place
UNK:UNK Great flatbreads and atmosphere
UNK:UNK I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
UNK:UNK Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.  Visit Date: 11/18/09
UNK:UNK I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.  Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.  I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.
UNK:UNK LOVE this place. Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.  I love this place, and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)
UNK:UNK Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!
UNK:UNK They have great specials and if you like dive mexican take out......its ok.....there are much better places that are not a chain.
UNK:UNK We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :(  For JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you.
UNK:UNK Excellent food! I always get the 3tacos! Best bang for your buck!
UNK:UNK I've been here twice for lunch. It's okay but I won't be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants I've been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.
UNK:UNK We loved this place.
UNK:UNK My wife and I have stayed in many hotels both domestic and international. From cheap hotels to very expensive resorts. For the price this hotel was a great deal. Very clean and friendly staff. Very close to the airport and provides FREE shuttle to/from airport.
UNK:UNK One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
UNK:UNK Love the wings!
UNK:UNK Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!
UNK:UNK Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
UNK:UNK Not that good, not that bad.  So-so, more or less.  Stopped by here for lunch the other day, I had the BBQ chicken lunch.  Overall a pretty bland taste, but maybe that is just the style.  If I ever end up here again I may try something else, but I won't be going out of my way to do so.
UNK:UNK Awesome place! I like the memorabilia on the walls.
UNK:UNK While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
UNK:UNK This place is gem behind the Central Phoenix library and next to Walgreens. They have great lunch specials that are worth a visit. My favorite dish so far is the spicy noodles. The noodles were flavorful and pretty darn spicy, just how they should be. If you're in the mood for some authentic Thai food, you gotta give this place a try.
UNK:UNK Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.
UNK:UNK This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.
UNK:UNK We got the Wiseguy with Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage.  I was very underwhelmed.  The pizza was really greasy and just not all that great-tasting.  Also the crust was burnt in several places, making it taste even worse.
UNK:UNK I eat here often because it is close to where I live. Good clean Chines food but it is all starting to taste the same like they use the same sauce on many of their dishes. It didn't used to be like that. I will keep going because it is still good and the best in the area IMHO, but it is time for a menu change to get some new flavors for those who eat there often.
UNK:UNK We eat dinner here often, usually with exemplary service and delicious food.  If you get seated in Tanya's section, ask to be moved immediately!  She was nice, but a terrible waitress.
UNK:UNK This surgery center was quite nice and my girlfriend's septoplasty/turbanoplasty/sinus surgery went off without a hitch and the doctors all seemed amazing, anyway, I didn't get a surgery, but my girlfriend couldn't be happier with her results.
UNK:UNK Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
UNK:UNK Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his "bedside" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!
UNK:UNK Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers.
UNK:UNK Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place.  P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool.
UNK:UNK Yummy breakfast!  Enjoyed the pancakes.
UNK:UNK We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!
UNK:UNK As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars.
UNK:UNK Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need.  The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then.
UNK:UNK Divorced?  Desperate?  Have a new corvette?  You've qualified for a trip to the lovely Martini Ranch where your next future trophy ex-wife is waiting for you!
UNK:UNK Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good.
UNK:UNK When I'm looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite.
UNK:UNK Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.
UNK:UNK this place rules, plain and simple  just wish they had a cheaper jukebox
UNK:UNK Huge burritos for $7. Enough for 2 people.  Fresh and tasty!  Plus very friendly service.  I prefer going here vs the Taco Bell in front of them :)
UNK:UNK LOVE LOVE LOVE riding my bike through here.  Especially on our way back, with all the down hills!!!!  It's like a roller coaster but better!!!!  I also drive through here every morning to get to work, so that is a nice, relaxing, pretty way to start my day.
UNK:UNK Truly a neighborhood bar. Didn't know anyone here, and didn't leave without catching  everyone's name. Maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeria-turned-bar in the same lot, but definitely lots more fun. Will return.
UNK:UNK I would give them a 5 if the service was better.  The food is always great.  I've tried 6 or 7 different versions of the calzone and the stromboli is awesome.  My boys love the pizza.  The price is great for the portion.  Great family spot and the delivery is on time.
UNK:UNK Its pretty expensive..  Everything's about 4 dollars minimum but the food is quality.  The flavors aren't very new and exciting, but you can tell the ingredients are quality and they don't skimp.  The texture is good quality.  Love the whole almonds in the rocky road!  :D
UNK:UNK Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up.
UNK:UNK The quintissential downtown scottsdale club. As snobby as it gets, but in an endearing way. I talked to Ice T and Coco at this club one time. For some reason I felt like I always was on the verge of punching somebody when I was in there. This place reminds me of the club in the beginning of American Psycho, reserved tables, the whole deal.
UNK:UNK Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
UNK:UNK I did not expect to enjoy a meal inside a mall.  I stopped here to fuel with fish and sake as shopping is such very hard work (sarcasm!). I sat at the bar and the sushi chefs' company absolutely made the experience.  I have certainly had better sushi, but the experience as a whole was great and I recommend stopping here if you happen to be shopping at the Fashion Square and need to recharge.
UNK:UNK I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the "S" coffee store.    One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.
UNK:UNK Way over priced but great food
UNK:UNK Very good place to eat.. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people, they always interact with their customers. I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want. I highly recommend this place.
UNK:UNK Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!  Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far.
UNK:UNK Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.
UNK:UNK My co-workers and I refer to this place as "Pizza n' Ants".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.     As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!
UNK:UNK My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!
UNK:UNK I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...
UNK:UNK They came to my house the same day that I called which was a pleasant surprise.  I'm glad that I didn't have to wait a week for them to fix our fuse box.  With labor at $65 per hour it's pretty affordable depending on what you want them to do.  Be aware that there might be two guys coming out to you though- so it'll be $65 per hour x2.
UNK:UNK Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends.
UNK:UNK The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!   Edamame was perfectly steamed  Sushi was tasty  Salmon Teriyaki was delicious  sake and kirin washed it all down  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.
UNK:UNK I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!
UNK:UNK I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead.
UNK:UNK Not a bad theater. The staff is friendly and the sound is ok.
UNK:UNK Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out.
UNK:UNK Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.
UNK:UNK I had heard they were spiced just right but for me it was too salty of a burger.  It was also expensive considering a I had a burger, hot dog, fries and a shake.  Not a favorite but wouldn't mind coming again.
UNK:UNK I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
UNK:UNK Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding.   I love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-) They also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen.   The parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes.
UNK:UNK Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
UNK:UNK I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwan's thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!
UNK:UNK Monday night attract a bros and hos crowd that thinks they are better than everyone else with a few cool people mixed in. The bar is small and there is nowhere to sit so prepare to stand all night. I will only come here on a Monday because there is nowhere else to go.
UNK:UNK This was just ok. I got the steakhouse salad, which came with four pieces of meat the size of quarters. I'm sorry, but that's no $13 salad. I had to send it back, because I asked for the meat to be cooked through and it was rare.  My dining partner said her pizza was tasteless.  It was very loud.  In all, it was too much money for what we got. We won't go back.
UNK:UNK What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.
UNK:UNK These guys have some yummy donuts and the prices are great.  Their donuts seems to be more authentic... they feel more hand made than machine made.   I'll be back.
UNK:UNK I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.
UNK:UNK We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside! We went with a local Hefe and it was great! The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didn't get a chance to try them out! See you there soon!
UNK:UNK Decent food at not unreasonable prices. The service is good. What is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio? The waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl. At the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons.
UNK:UNK Chambord margaritas are killer!
UNK:UNK I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...
UNK:UNK A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim.
UNK:UNK This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.
UNK:UNK Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5  I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.
UNK:UNK Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)
UNK:UNK Dave's has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and side's.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!    Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group.  Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldn't turn it down!  Enjoy!
UNK:UNK Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there don't let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!
UNK:UNK Had the super burger and fries tonight... excellent!   I like that while they do have some tv's on with sports on them... the house music takes front stage.  Might be different on big playoff nights.  Also... the tequila thyme drink... delicious and actually had some  alchyhol in it!  Fantastic!
UNK:UNK Great food and friendly staff.   The chips and salsa were very good. So were the chicken chimichangas. Great prices too!
UNK:UNK R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.   We will be going back!
UNK:UNK Bizarre location with good food. Don't expect an "environment". It's poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it.
UNK:UNK Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish.
UNK:UNK I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time, and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!
UNK:UNK I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.
UNK:UNK If you like a juicy sub and you don't mind onions... Ask for your sub to be made Mike's way! It's excellent.
UNK:UNK Kudos to the manager for reaching out to make our next visit here better!! The wings still rank high in my book, alongside the buffalo chicken dip!!! Our waitress was super helpful & gave terrific service! Thanks for making our 2nd visit to Half Moon one which makes us want to return again in the future!
UNK:UNK Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. It's not really on my side of town but I'd really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks.
UNK:UNK What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!
UNK:UNK I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay. The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.   It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations.
UNK:UNK I was in Mesa for a workshop over the weekend, and this was a convenient place to eat. I wasn't overly impressed. The food was ok, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I expected more from Mexican food in AZ.
UNK:UNK Went there today for lunch for the first time and had the del Reyes torta. I was full after one half of this monster. But was very good.
UNK:UNK Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.
UNK:UNK Lots of awesome packed in a cute little restaurant. Visited here on numerous occasions and never had to wait for a table. Service is excellent; friendly, and witty waitresses are a breath of fresh air. As is the patio, which is a perfect venue to enjoy a meal next to the fountains. The view of the gardens at lunch time is also a nice tidbit.   Loved the chips too. Chimichanga is A-okay!
UNK:UNK Our first visit. A bit quiet on a Monday night. Service was fast and friendly. Wife and I shared a hommus appetizer and Greek fries. We like our hommus with more zest i.e. garlic. Main courses were the gyro dinner and chicken souvlaki meal. Both were tasty with generous portions. We'll go back.
UNK:UNK Fast and a drive thru. What more is there?
UNK:UNK This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
UNK:UNK Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.
UNK:UNK Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.
UNK:UNK I loved the concept of this yougurt place. It is much better than Pinkberry in California. You can serve yourself a variety of flavors of yogurt. I got white boy vanilla and acai along with Mango. You pay for your yogurt by weight. This was a great place!
UNK:UNK It's not that I don't like this place, it's just that it's very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. That's all that can really be said about this place. You can't really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average..
UNK:UNK They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.  Bonnie Wills
UNK:UNK Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.
UNK:UNK Great place to go for a walk or bike ride.
UNK:UNK It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all. I love it here it's clean, great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!
UNK:UNK Stop by today for California Burger and I also their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, this place is definitely something that you will want to try. The help is friendly and helpful.
UNK:UNK short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack.   I can't wait until they come back!
UNK:UNK I love this place!  Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices.  In the Fry's parking lot.  Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice.  Good stuff.
UNK:UNK Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadn't tried it before, but I'll be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!
UNK:UNK Went back for a 2nd go-round.  This time I got the B&G also.  It really was fantastic.  The gravy was about as perfect as can be with one exception - there weren't any sausage chunks.    I opted for the country potatoes which I did not like at all - they were WAY too onion-y.  The hash browns are great.  This place gets high marks for the service - the owners are very friendly and welcoming.
UNK:UNK First hole in one on #3. I'll always love you Vistal.
UNK:UNK The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the last time I went the chips and bean dip really satisfied the fact that I hadn't eaten all day.  Too bad the enchiladas sucked (thick, soggy tortillas???? and beef with too much black pepper???????), the rice sucked, and even the cheese on top of my refried beans sucked.
UNK:UNK came here last Saturday night with a friend. the food is very good and you get a large portion - I had leftovers for lunch the next day. my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burnt/crispy than I like. I will be back to try their weekend buffet though.
UNK:UNK Maybe the bagels are good, but i made the mistake of getting a chicken sandwich.. Yuck!
UNK:UNK Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.
UNK:UNK I'll check this place out, despite the whinings of a few.
UNK:UNK I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor.  One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash...
UNK:UNK I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.  It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.  Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.
UNK:UNK This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
UNK:UNK Great tourist fare. When we have family in town that appreciate a 32oz porterhouse more than a delicate sashimi, this is where we head. It is quite the drive from Phoenix, but portions are large and service is always prompt and friendly.
UNK:UNK I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.
UNK:UNK This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.
UNK:UNK I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
UNK:UNK Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.
UNK:UNK Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
UNK:UNK This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.
UNK:UNK Really great finds. Helped me stock a vintage 60's bar.  Ron is very helpful and knows where everything is in the store.  Great at finding knick nacks such as distressed wood, door knobs, irons, kitchen wares, etc.  Something for everyone.
UNK:UNK We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!  Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.   My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!  This is what Rubios is about!
UNK:UNK A very nice pizza.  I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's.  Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.
UNK:UNK Great food!  The FEZ burger is a real winner.  The staff and clientele are friendly.  Great place to meet people for drinks and hang out.
UNK:UNK This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.
UNK:UNK Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.
UNK:UNK Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have.
UNK:UNK Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
UNK:UNK Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun, easy and worth every penny.
UNK:UNK Great Thanksgiving meal. I had a similar meal at Busters on the Lake for cheaper last year but that doesn't take away from the good spinach and sweet potatoes. Good service, good bread, good view...
UNK:UNK Smaller than the Chandler location, but definitely a great place to find bargains. Come here prepared to do a bit of digging (especially in the shoe section) and expect to wait in line.
UNK:UNK Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......
UNK:UNK Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often.
UNK:UNK Great addition to the Indian School corridor.  I love the location along the canal and the patio has great views of Camelback Mountain.  There is an extensive beer list and the drafts are reasonably priced.  The vibe is very cool and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful.
UNK:UNK More than the food, the place is cute. What it looks like from the outside does no justice for the inside.  Very Americanized Asian food so if you're looking for authentic... don't come here.
UNK:UNK I am not only new to the area, but to the southwest. I'm so excited to try food from as many taquerias as possible to find my favorite. Taqueria Los Angeles is yummy and super inexpensive. $5 for "your choice of two" with rice and beans. I will certainly return.
UNK:UNK Fairly typical Walgreens. Sell beer and wine now. Photo and pharmacy. Redbox movies.
UNK:UNK First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.
UNK:UNK I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it
UNK:UNK Food was good. Slow service. First time that I've had to walk outside through a parking lot to get to the bathroom.
UNK:UNK I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, they're on top. Good Starbucks.
UNK:UNK Good food and really good beer.  In fact, on certain days their own micro-brews are a dollar a pint.  That's right, one dollar a pint for liquid sunshine.  The pizza is ok, but the beer is why I go.  Try it for yourself, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree.
UNK:UNK This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
UNK:UNK Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they don't crank up the volume.  Check this place out!
UNK:UNK Machaca Burro is ridiculous and the butter tortilla will take you to the promised land
UNK:UNK Food was decent, not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though...  Probably the most expensive Mexican place of it's style. $25 for a burro, two tostadas, and two mini-tacos. Seriously?! Also, no free refills or chips/salsa.  Are we going back? No.
UNK:UNK Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.
UNK:UNK I was a little bit scared to eat at this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the chicken egg foo yung and boyfriend got spicy shrimp. The portions were humongous and it was very delicious. The Buffett didn't look very appetizing. I would definitely only order from the dinner menu. Can't wait to go back.  Food is dirt cheap and so delicious.
UNK:UNK I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
UNK:UNK Food is just ok, but the problem is it's way overpriced! I mean $9 for loco moco? Outrageous!
UNK:UNK My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular! Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!
UNK:UNK LOVE IT! Food & Service always great!
UNK:UNK Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.
UNK:UNK The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!
UNK:UNK This place might have one of the best beer selections at a reasonable price in all of Tempe. Possibly in the East Valley. Their food is great too, service is decent, and the daily specials they offer are just plain awesome!
UNK:UNK I have to say they are better than Subway, that's for sure. At least they put meat and cheese and the fixing's on your Sub not like subway where they measure everything and you get home and you pretty much just taste the bread. The staff is young but very polite and helpful. Maybe a little suggestion...if you can make homemade salads like Macaroni, potato salad it would be alot better.
UNK:UNK I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to "turn the table".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!
UNK:UNK nice and trendy restaurant with great food! will definitely come back again!
UNK:UNK I'm very excited about their authentic and inexpensive menu. We just had appetizers today, but can't wait to come back for dinner. The mofongo and alcapurrias were beautiful.
UNK:UNK What has happened to the Coffee Plantation? I've been out of the Valley for 8 yrs. and the Coffee Plantation was always such a good place for food, bakery items, and of course coffee. On my last visit the store was dirty, the full menu of food was gone, and the coffee was burnt. I went to the Biltmore and alas that location was gone. Where did my old Coffee Plantation go?
UNK:UNK Great fast service! Friendly girls that carried on fun conversations. Beautiful salon with nice pedicure chairs. Great prices too!
UNK:UNK Mole sauce was amazing! Chicken was a little dry, but searously the mole sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon. Skip the fundido.  The waiter could not explain some of the items on the menu, which was funny. The hicima tostado was great!  so was the mango crab salad.
UNK:UNK Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
UNK:UNK I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.
UNK:UNK Good clean Chili's. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the "2 for $20" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal.
UNK:UNK The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business.   Go double. Add bacon. Park at Circle K if in a hurry. Plan on holding it until you get home. Stick to the burger and fries, genius.
UNK:UNK My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.
UNK:UNK This place is a little pricey- but you get what you pay for. Johanna's flow class is great. The only con I have is that classes can be packed, they don't offer tons of early morning classes- but this is the best place in the valley, by far, for yoga.
UNK:UNK They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...
UNK:UNK Great early bird specials on wine and mini-pitchers of beer before 5pm, only $5.  The food is very good and taylored to a wine menu.  A very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other.
UNK:UNK Loved it! Best French toast ever!
UNK:UNK Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.
UNK:UNK Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!
UNK:UNK Great breakfast and lunch food in Scottsdale.  Very cool that you can do drive-thru and come in for a quick, delicious meal.
UNK:UNK Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good
UNK:UNK Awesome pizza, great cocktails, and salads. Friendly staff. A favorite!
UNK:UNK Great girls night out place.  Wine selection was extensive and we DEVOURED the Bruschetta!  Try to get there for the Happy Hour prices or you will be paying a minimum of $9 per glass of wine.   One of my new fave places :)
UNK:UNK Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try
UNK:UNK Friendly staff. Fast check-out.  Great selection.
UNK:UNK Not bad, but not my first choice for the area. The staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club.  That being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. I think I need more... of something.
UNK:UNK Mmmmmmmm Saganaki!  This place is a very good value, delicious really! Kind of a cute little dive with AMAZING food.  This place makes me think of a few close friends who brought me there. Good times! Good place!
UNK:UNK This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off!
UNK:UNK Chill coffee bar. That is the best way to describe it. Very unique. All the plates are different. Comfy chairs. Desks. Fresh flowers on the tables. I sipped on hibiscus green ice tea and munched on the best coconut macaroon on my life. Yes, I am willing to go there. Must try. Stop going to Starbucks and start supporting coffee shops with personality, unless your a boring dud.
UNK:UNK Finally tried this place after passing it weekly for the last year or so. Atmosphere is pretty cool, but food lacked any special quality. Large glass of orange juice was nearly $6.00...WITHOUT the vodka (lol)! Hash browns were kind of burned, and small portion to boot. Probably won't go back, as there are so many other breakfast places nearby that are much better.
UNK:UNK Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.  Dined with a large group so we had a set menu. I requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case I felt the chicken was too dry.  It was de-lish!
UNK:UNK LOVE it here.  Small, homey, and yummy food.  Great patio!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!  The kid loves it...especially the beans.  They have jamaica, horchata and tamarindo fresh made to drink too.  YUM!
UNK:UNK This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.
UNK:UNK Ticoz is not a bad place.  The menu is eclectic-american and the service has always been friendly, consistent, and attentive.  All the food I've had there has been decent and the prices aren't bad either.  This is a gay friendly restaurant so it's a good place to consider for a same-sex date.  It's also a good place for large groups.
UNK:UNK It was ok, there was a large group of us and we all enjoyed the appitizers, including the table side guac.  Biggest complaint was how poorly their bar was stocked.  No Chivas, no Sambuca, weak margaritas, etc.  So while the service was good, the food was just ok and the bar needs to be stocked better.  There is room for improvement.
UNK:UNK LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film critics today????
UNK:UNK Service was great, food was ok, restaurant was clean, but the price was more than it's worth.
UNK:UNK The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.  Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.
UNK:UNK I visited Smeeks this weekend as part of Carmelpalooza. Amazing! It's a fun little store with darling treats and trinkets to drop your cash upon.  Bacon belt? Yep. Women's mustaches? Of course! Butterscotch Peanut butter cups? Yes! Very fun. A bit pricey, but I couldn't resist buying some monster finger puppet key toppers. Yay Yay Yay!
UNK:UNK Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos. That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu. Great hangover food. The staff is always very friendly!
UNK:UNK Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.
UNK:UNK All of the restaurants are excellent:  Houston's, Bandera, Rutherford Grill (Napa), and Los Altos Grill.  Service has been excellent every time.  All the food is excellent, however make sure you get the Tortilla Soup if available.  The ribs, french dip, and hot fudge sundae are great too.
UNK:UNK Sun Up is my favorite craft brewery in AZ. Brewmaster Uwe is German and brews creative - quality American ales with a euro twist. While there are regular beers, the cask conditioned and strong ales change regularly. Recently they had 4 different kinds of IPA. Central Phoenix highlight - must visit. Order off of the chalk board - seasonal ales are the highlight here.
UNK:UNK This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
UNK:UNK Good food
UNK:UNK 4 star service 2 star food = 3 stars.  The bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved, not grilled.  The bacon was just OK.  The prices are HIGH, both for the menu & the grocery.  Wi-fi is unreliable.  When it goes out, it takes them 15-20 min to reset it.  Great friendly service.  Nice, sunny outdoor seating.
UNK:UNK My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome!  Great place, we will be back!
UNK:UNK Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
UNK:UNK Better than Starbucks anyday!  The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as "The Annihilator".. My personal Favorite: "The Cookie with a little raspberry"
UNK:UNK Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasn't a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group.
UNK:UNK I've heard when better waitresses are there, service is better, but if you go on the night she isn't there, service sucks.
UNK:UNK Great place to meet friends for a bite and some drinks.  Very social atmosphere and the food is really great.  Service did not disappoint and the prices are really fair.
UNK:UNK Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!
UNK:UNK Great margaritas, but kinda pricy for what they have. Their food isn't all that special :(
UNK:UNK Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!
UNK:UNK My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.
UNK:UNK Pretty delicious -- very tasty sashimi platter. Loved the ambiance too -- a nice respite from the very toasty desert outside. :)
UNK:UNK This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.
UNK:UNK Came here for lunch and had the calzone and salad combo and it was very good. The portion sizes are just right and the food is tasty!
UNK:UNK I only go to ihop for pancakes because I don't really like anything else on the menu. Ordered chocolate chip pancakes and a hot chocolate. Everything was great and I left full and satisfied!!
UNK:UNK Thanks to all of you Yelpers for recommending this place! It was just what I have been looking for in my neighborhood- fresh and tasty Chinese food for a decent price unspoiled by trendiness. Thanks! I will definitely add Deserg Jade to my regular rotation.
UNK:UNK Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go.   I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.
UNK:UNK I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
UNK:UNK John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
UNK:UNK Outstanding service and food , drinks are not bad. Service can't be beat.
UNK:UNK We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.
UNK:UNK Went to this place with family for a birthday party and tried various items from the menu.  Wasn't impressed with the food and the quality of the items.  I've had better and will not be back since there are better places to dine at in the valley.  Sorry for being kind of harsh but I am only being real.
UNK:UNK So much better that 5 Dorks, I mean guys.  They have salads and great chicken selections!
UNK:UNK Nice little find for casual sushi
UNK:UNK Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
UNK:UNK Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic.
UNK:UNK The food here was great! Wish there was more indoor seating, but the seating both indoor and outside is nice, live music sometimes, nice decor.  I've tried a few of the specialty drinks, some are good some are so/so but isn't it always that way? Just preferences.  The prices are a bit high, but the portions are worth it, we can split a meal typically.  The Deserts are awesome too!
UNK:UNK Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.
UNK:UNK Superb service and food. Better than average wine list. Steaks and seafood were cooked expertly, sides were just right. Seafood tower was put together appropriately for our 6 person group. I gave 4, not 4 1/2 or 5, stars because it was just tood darned dark and noisy. But still an excellent experience. Pricey as expected, but not overpriced.
UNK:UNK Very good coffee!  I get my iced Americano here with room for cream.  The coffee is so much better than the Starbucks down the street, but not as convenient...shamefully to say, there's no drive-through.  When you have a vehicle full of kids which one would you pick?  So, I come here solo right before I wander around the little shops.  A must try!
UNK:UNK Atmosphere is like I'm at a Mexican/Chinese/Jamaican restaurant..... cuisine could be better.
UNK:UNK Bobby Q is GREAT! We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!! Blooming onion - just right! Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!  Our waitress perfect - Go - now!
UNK:UNK Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to. I can't even drink this margarita.
UNK:UNK www.tiltondevelopment.com supports our local community newspapers!
UNK:UNK Pretty good. Excellent deals for happy hour.  The vegetable tempura, miso soup, salad, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, california rolls, and crunch rolls were very good.  The spicy tuna was a little bland. Our children even enjoyed the food.
UNK:UNK Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
UNK:UNK This is a great place for grilled cheese and tomato soup.  They also have a great selection of beers on tap.  Parking is hit or miss, but you can't miss a cute house that has been converted to a great gastropub.  Always a friendly face and you will always run into good folks.
UNK:UNK I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. It's great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldn't be spending all day there.
UNK:UNK Ok.  Not great for what is supposedly a good steak joint.  Not much ambiance and food was good not great.
UNK:UNK Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!
UNK:UNK Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff, great food, great times.
UNK:UNK I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.  My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.
UNK:UNK Angelina's Pho and grill was very good! excellent appetisers; which were very fresh and brought to us in a very timely manor. The service was very good! restaurant was very clean, as was bathroom!  the pho was good, not the best best in the valley but very good! the broth was a little bit too salty for me. we will defintely go to this pho restaurant again!
UNK:UNK Not your typical deli meat-this is the real deal with the shredded turkey.  Very good.
UNK:UNK Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house.
UNK:UNK not a bad place for pizza... it is very infomral and the pizza is good... they have a nice beer selection... if you want to get a pie, beer and salad in Old Town and that is all you really want this is the place... the menu is baiscally pizza, beer and salad... but all good...
UNK:UNK We came here because we figured it wouldn't be busy; we were right.   But, to our amazement, the food was really good. I had an extremely flavorful cheeseburger that was as good as any burger I have had in Phoenix.   Thankfully, herd instinct will keep the masses flocking to lesser establishments like Lenny's, In-N-Out and Lucky Boyz so we can have Village Inn practically to ourselves.
UNK:UNK Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!  Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!  Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)  You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.
UNK:UNK Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.
UNK:UNK Had an outstanding lunch here.  The view is amazing, their cheese fondue dip was delicious, and they serve up a tasty burger.  I definitely recommend it and would come back in a heartbeat on my next visit to Phoenix.
UNK:UNK Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
UNK:UNK Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.
UNK:UNK I have two thoughts on what to write for a review so here are both and you can take your pick.  Dear Mr. and Mrs. Postinto, We regret to inform you that we would like our menu back. Sincerely, 2007  or  Stale bread - YES Please!
UNK:UNK The service has always been really good.  I love LOTS of things on the menu. The dixie pan fried chicken is great.  There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.  The Del mar salad is great.  I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.    Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES, let's go there!
UNK:UNK A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about "being taken" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.
UNK:UNK Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've"ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds.
UNK:UNK Love this place, sushi is good and great customer service!
UNK:UNK I have attended several performances at the MCA and enjoyed them all.  The physical facilities are top notch and the outdoor areas (when the weather is accommodating) is lovely.
UNK:UNK I do not eat fast food.  i do eat at in-n-out.  mmmm double double animal style
UNK:UNK Great Job!
UNK:UNK The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale
UNK:UNK We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded.   This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.  The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain.   There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.
UNK:UNK Pei Wei is a family favorite, especially for take out. I can call Pei Wei while I leave the house, order my food as I drive, and when I arrive 9 times out of 10 the food is hot and ready to roll. The food is always tasty and at a fair price. We love it.
UNK:UNK I've swung into Echo a few times and haven't ever had a bad cup of coffee. The cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread I had for breakfast one day was a win. If I recall correctly it came in a cute little box too.  For some reason I've never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there. Not sure why, but just haven't.
UNK:UNK i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.
UNK:UNK Awesome place. Staff is very helpfull!
UNK:UNK As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonald's yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more.
UNK:UNK I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.
UNK:UNK Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds.
UNK:UNK This place is too loud.  It would have been nice to have a meal without some lady yelling 'meatlog' across the room.  Also the waitstaff was somewhat incompetent and snobby.  The food was delicious but it's not something anyone can make themselves at home.  They are stingy with their bread even though it is now free. Lots of annoying things that will probably persuade me not to come back.
UNK:UNK These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
UNK:UNK Love the atmosphere and how trendy rhus place is, reminds me of Nip/tuck kinda, the way they have it set up. I had thd NY strip steak and i don not think it was worth the price. The steak did not come with a side. Sides are ordered seperately. Great customer service, however I don't think I will be eating here again.
UNK:UNK It's ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess that's good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didn't find it here.
UNK:UNK The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe I'll write another review when something outrageous happens :)
UNK:UNK Super!
UNK:UNK Best value for your money,   Clean, comfy beds.  Quite.  Great breakfast that is included.
UNK:UNK I have a love/hate relationship with Costco. I love to support local businesses, but this is one of a couple of exceptions I make.  It seems they treat their employees fairly as most of the employees at this store seem to have been there for years if not a decade. One thing that gives me comfort in my purchasing is they have a terrific return policy and take about anything back.
UNK:UNK After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJ's.  It was decent.   It seemed a bit over priced.   The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order.   The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours.   Will I go back? Maybe.   Was I impressed? Not really.  Did I leave full? Yes.
UNK:UNK 3.5 stars  Came here for HH on a Tuesday. Loved the ambience, sort of a beachy type feel. We ordered all the appetizers listed for HH, including the sliders, grilled cheese sandwich, wings (buffalo), and bruschetta. Food was decent, my favorite being the grilled cheese sandwich. A nice place to wind down with good company.
UNK:UNK This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.    The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!
UNK:UNK It's called "Babeway" for a reason people...   But I go here for the Deli, they have the best panini. I like to stop in for the 3 cheese panini with mustard and tomato. It's also a good choice to pair up with the Italian wedding soup.
UNK:UNK This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.  Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com
UNK:UNK I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if you're blasted.
UNK:UNK The facility is very clean and I got in and out quick.  However, the staff lacks personality and friendliness.
UNK:UNK The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.  I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring.  Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu.
UNK:UNK First time experience. Tried turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu. Burger was ok but greasy. They served me a salad that has gone bad.  You donot serve a salad with rotting vegetables. Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace.
UNK:UNK Tacos and enchilada today. Good flavor & fresh salsa. Fast service and very friendly staff today (even though they were understaffed). You will enjoy Rudys lf you have never been.  Authentic AZ mexican food.
UNK:UNK Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.
UNK:UNK Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe.   Be Back soon need some work done
UNK:UNK we to the amazing Thai bistro on a Friday night. the food was great. i had gluten free seafood curry. very spicy. we had a large party and they were very accommodating. we sat at the bar waiting for our friends and some how they handed out free shots! bonus for my friends that drink.  i will be going back and enjoying this great place! they do have a gluten free!!!!
UNK:UNK Pleasant restaurant with a variety of rooms. Farm fresh food is always better than frozen. Great place to relax and talk with your table mate.
UNK:UNK I tried out Corleone's today for lunch and I could not believe the size of the lunch. For the money it was a great value. I thought the bread was a little soggy but it was good.  The place was crowed but the guy working was working hard. I would definitely go again.
UNK:UNK Took almost 45 mins for a oil change (they told me 20 mins when I got there) and it cost something like that as well...  Slow and expensive, not 2 things I like associated with my lube jobs.
UNK:UNK Take the whole family and get a nice table outside. The burgers are good, the fried zucchini is better and the the barbecue chicken is amazing...
UNK:UNK This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.   Keep it Simple Stupid KISS
UNK:UNK Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going...
UNK:UNK Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
UNK:UNK Margaritas were good, tacos were fair (small), guacamole was wonderful. after ten it gets really loud here. They need to have tequila flights.
UNK:UNK Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!
UNK:UNK Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done.
UNK:UNK It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour. Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience. You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome.
UNK:UNK Flavor was good and it was very clean.  Only complaint is that it melted very fast, but if you eat it there (as I did twice), it's not a problem.
UNK:UNK Came to Blanco Tacos during Restaurant Week 2009. The guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy! The flan was also delicious. I will come back just to eat the flan!   The scene was pretty cool. Fun people watching environment.
UNK:UNK Got a pretty decent HAND car wash for $15.00.  They asked about extras but weren't pushy about it.  After I paid I noticed their gas prices.  They were about $0.20 less than the going rate in the area.  The frosting on the cake was that I got a $2.00 senior discount.
UNK:UNK Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.  He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.   Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.  I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.  I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!
UNK:UNK waitress wasn't good with service. mongolian beef dish sucks. fish is just ok. rock bottom is usually pretty good, but this one in scottsdale is not that great.
UNK:UNK Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
UNK:UNK Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. I've had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. It's a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lee's, but unfortunately they definitely aren't quite there yet with the competition.
UNK:UNK Always fresh and friendly.  Food is priced just a skosh above the actual value but, the place is clean, people are nice.  Worth trying?  Yes!  Lunchtime sushi is great.  Teriyaki bowl is good.    Brown rice extra...booo.  Overall worth the very close the the $9.00 you will spend on lunch at Yogis
UNK:UNK If you're heading to a show at the Scottsdale Center For The Performing Arts, this is your best convenient bet for dinner (if you like Indian food).  It's average but can probably satisfy your curry craving.
UNK:UNK LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.
UNK:UNK Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
UNK:UNK If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by! The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the "cookie monster" which is awesome!)
UNK:UNK I like harkins. This isn't as good as some of their newer ones, but it's still good.  Seats were comfortable, sound system was OK, screen was a tad small (but maybe I'm getting spoiled).  Staff seemed friendly.  It was a good experience.  Last time we were here we did the IMAX, and it is a great IMAX.
UNK:UNK I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place.
UNK:UNK If you go prepared and early, you can be in and out within an hour. If your not 100% sure what you need, go online and check BEFORE you go. Save yourself the time and hassle of making that second trip. Not bad overall.
UNK:UNK If I had a higher salary, I would shop here. I love this store, however the only reason I come here is if I am looking for something you can't get at a large grocery chain like a Fry's Marketplace.  They have a great wine selection, fine imported cheeses and the pastry counter makes your mouth water. When they are having a sale on steak I always buy it here.
UNK:UNK That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot.
UNK:UNK Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.
UNK:UNK Although they didn't have what I was looking for, the help was friendly and the store was very nicely kept. And they had a decent selection of course everything is a dollar. So I said " you guys are okay in my book (A-OK) one of the good ones" so I won't rule them out when I'm looking for dollar deals.
UNK:UNK No bad for a chain.
UNK:UNK It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!
UNK:UNK Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special.
UNK:UNK I like frozen stuff. Ice cream, frozen bananas, mountaintop snow, icebergs, glaciers, frozen caveman lawyers - all good.  A friend introduced me to Golden Spoon this afternoon. What a great treat! They have convenient little portions for the sensible and great big portions for the more gluttonous. It tastes great, costs little, and really hits the spot.
UNK:UNK In my opinion, Zipps is the king of the local sports bars.  They've got decent bar food, great beer specials on Sundays, and I've always had attentive, friendly service.  What more do you want?
UNK:UNK Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.
UNK:UNK Great all natural selection, if you are looking for some fruit or veggie that is hard to find, try here, they will probably have it.  I also love that they have organic roasted chickens (yummy).  The stores often have wine tastings and demos going on, check their website for listings of events.
UNK:UNK The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, it's hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them.  However, I will go here when I don't have to pay.  Why not, right?
UNK:UNK I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
UNK:UNK If you're looking for a board game, card game or, well, ANY game you can't find at GameStop, try here! Their selection is huge, from games to figurines to key chains and novelty candy. Better yet, they're friendly and really seem to know what they're talking about.   They also offer in-store tournaments and competitions. So much fun!
UNK:UNK Unfortunately Out of Business.
UNK:UNK had the bulkogi mini plate. very cheap at $5, but it's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky. the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the potato-mac salad.
UNK:UNK The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location.  However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy.
UNK:UNK Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)
UNK:UNK This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.  I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.  Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.  The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!
UNK:UNK Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!  But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.
UNK:UNK I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.
UNK:UNK I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
UNK:UNK I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!
UNK:UNK Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that.
UNK:UNK Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you don't mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess.
UNK:UNK I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.
UNK:UNK we thtumbled into thiths playth a few monthths ago and it waths aMAYYYYZthing!!! totally gay but the decor waths awethsome and retro, like for therial. they had tonths of gaymths and it waths thso good!   if you voted yeth on prop 8, you're stho thupid.
UNK:UNK Yucca is a great neighborhood library, if I may say so.  It's not huge, but you can place holds on anything from any Phoenix library, get on the internet, read the paper, and any number of other things.
UNK:UNK Dear Weather & Coffee,  I'm really sorry you had to close.  We had a lot of good times together.  Every time I came in, you always seemed really happy to see me... even though you knew me by the wrong name.    I may be Kelly to everyone else, but I'll always be Aubrey to you.
UNK:UNK Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.  And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.
UNK:UNK North Glendale's cool new  hangout.  Formerly Cactus Willy's.  Completely remodelled!  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!
UNK:UNK Concept is great.  Stores are cool, but expensive.  Lunch was a bummer!  Ordered chicken salad sandwich and the tiny sandwich on a great roll with the tiniest amount of chicken salad was disappointing.  For that money I expected at least a regular sized sandwich.  Glad we tried it, but won't eat there again.
UNK:UNK As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it "overcooked tasting" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.  I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.
UNK:UNK The only plus to this place was that the bartenders are on their game, otherwise leave it for the Jersey Shore wannabes and slooters that get turned on by extra extra medium Tap Out t-shirts.
UNK:UNK We've been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  It's a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are 'meh'.  We'll come again because it's a good spot for the kids, but we'll come expecting not great service.
UNK:UNK I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.
UNK:UNK I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner.
UNK:UNK I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
UNK:UNK This is our neighborhood restaurant.  Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch. I never disappoint.
UNK:UNK I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.
UNK:UNK This place has good fast food, it's always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice.   My kids love the play area and it's a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place.
UNK:UNK This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young. Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!
UNK:UNK I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasn't impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but I've had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs.
UNK:UNK Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!
UNK:UNK Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best.
UNK:UNK I'm on a Outback kick.  I can't help it.  We ended up here one evening by chance and I love their steak and loaded mashed potato.  The service is good, the food is good, it's not too crowded.  Like I say, I'm on a kick.
UNK:UNK Got to love the concept, coffee, art and a co-work space friendly for start-ups.  OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft.  The coffee is good, the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they don't harass you, I couldn't ask for more to get work done!
UNK:UNK The classic example of why we need half stars.  Doesn't merit a four star endorsement but slightly better than the three star Meh.  The hot dogs are decent but you'd expect more due to the pedigree of the owners.  The place also doesn't feel well put together and like it's been neglected in recent times.
UNK:UNK Great food, great service, very nice ambiance!
UNK:UNK Great place for all your favorite kinds of Asian food.  Wonderful service...it's a big place and they were busy, but since someone in our group was in a hurry to get to a flight they still managed to hurry things along.  Overall good food and huge portions.  The Happy Hour specials are great, too, so be sure to come during that time.
UNK:UNK This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
UNK:UNK A bit slow for an airport setting and the staff were blaming each other for an order gone wrong for the customer in front of me...tacky.
UNK:UNK Pretty good. Oxtail was awesome. Plantains were just like I remembered them in the Carribbeans. The jerk chicken was okay... Needs a little more heat. Beef patty good (I'd eat it again). The workers were outstandingly nice.
UNK:UNK I thought this place was outstanding! The staff was awesome, the food was excellent, overall appearance of restaurant was nice!
UNK:UNK We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!
UNK:UNK Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.
UNK:UNK This is a great venue other than it being in the middle of nowhere.  Went to see Rockband Live (The Cab, Plain white T's, Dashboard Confessional, and Panic at the Disco). A good lineup for what was pretty much a promotional event.  The concert was great, the sound system and acoustics are pretty much perfect. I highly recommend seeing your favorite band play at Jobing.com arena!
UNK:UNK I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!
UNK:UNK Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state.
UNK:UNK Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.
UNK:UNK If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!
UNK:UNK Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!
UNK:UNK Decent sports bar.  Don't get me wrong, they have tons of beer choices, decent to good service, and plenty of pub fare...  Few things that bugged me last time..  No waitress for about 5 minutes after I sat down  Southwest egg rolls, while good, were tiny compared to other places  Too many tv's had the volume on..  the football game was impossible to hear..  I'll be back though..
UNK:UNK Great happy hour deals here! I loved the Cotija grilled corn and BBQ pork cheese crisp and was extremely jealous of my friend's order of the shrimp and corn cheese crisp that she enjoyed. Drinks were yummy and reasonable. I can't wait to come back to order that shrimp and corn cheese crisp and maybe some fresh guacamole.
UNK:UNK This airport is the most confusing airport I've ever been to.  Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go.
UNK:UNK I am not a fan of american mexican food, good thing they don't serve that fare here. The taquitos take me back to the streets of tijuana without the risk of "after effects" :)
UNK:UNK Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
UNK:UNK My best friend and I found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at Mimi's Cafe... so happy we did! Food is great and everyone is so friendly. You can eat out on the patio with shaded tables, or you can eat inside while they play great music (we were dancing to James Brown while ordering our food). It'll be our new breakfast spot from now on!
UNK:UNK Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.
UNK:UNK Good food at a good price.
UNK:UNK I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.  I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.
UNK:UNK I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside.
UNK:UNK Great chai lattes and friendly service!
UNK:UNK This is good pizza every time I get it.  I've never eaten in so can't comment on the service but when I go to pick it up it's always ready and the cashiers seem friendly enough.
UNK:UNK I absolutely love their personal hotpot room!  I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again! Their item portion is big and fresh!  Only downside is that there isn't any sauce that is pre-made... Other than that, this place is AMAZING
UNK:UNK I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing!   Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!   And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!
UNK:UNK We went on a Saturday night and the place was completely dead. There was only one other couple in the entire restaurant section. Very nice decor, but the food was mediocre at best. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the service was outstanding.
UNK:UNK Update:   They now have Coors and Miller Lite on draft.  Yay!  They're a real bar again.  I don't know the drama, but apparently the management has been "let go" and the owner is now managing the place.
UNK:UNK Absolutely awful... these guys have NO idea what they are doing!
UNK:UNK Although a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), the martinis are GREAT, as is the food (the cobb salad is the best I've ever had).  Good service, cool crowd... can't wait until I can go back, which sadly is not soon enough now that I live in San Diego.
UNK:UNK It is my favorite vietnamese restaurant. It's small but clean. Their soups are great. They serve fresh and tasty foods. Portion is not big enough for me though. I wish they serve bigger size meals.
UNK:UNK Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.  IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park.
UNK:UNK It's a pretty standard Panda Express- cheap pre-made Chinese food with a few different choices.  This one has always had good service, been prompt and never had a problem finding a place to sit.  They are also clean inside.  Good Panda.
UNK:UNK Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things.
UNK:UNK The place is good- the sushi is fresh and they have pretty awesome fish tanks (love me some puffers) in there.  My only complaint is that the miso soup is a whopping $4!  Is it just me?  Or is that too expensive?  Most sushi places that I frequent have it for about half the price... or it is included in the meal.  Other than that- I'm a fan :)
UNK:UNK What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!
UNK:UNK Average sushi but lots of fun.  I love just taking things off the conveyer belt.  Alcohol is also a bit pricey.
UNK:UNK Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until. Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm. Really?? Obviously don't care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks. Next!
UNK:UNK Chicken noodle in a bread bowl.  Sandwiches are good too :)
UNK:UNK Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!
UNK:UNK Best basic $12 in/exterior wash i got in a while. Didnt even have to tell them to wipe down anything.
UNK:UNK Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!
UNK:UNK No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun "home" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously.
UNK:UNK Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!
UNK:UNK 4 stars based on the sangria alone.  Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.  If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar.
UNK:UNK We had a great time. Had bottle service with Katie. who was super friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday. The music and atmosphere were great.
UNK:UNK So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!
UNK:UNK Had the Jalapeno burger.  Great stuff.  If you have not eaten here yet, I highly recommend it.  I've Had their Tri Tip, Beef & Pork Ribs, Pork, Brisket & Burgers along with most of their sides.  All were excellent.  Their Drink specials were great as well.
UNK:UNK Huge fan of this bistro. Everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try.  The staff is super awesome and Brant is my go to guy.  I highly recommend sangria sundays, the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites. Not to mention, the sweet potato fries and Purple Haze beer.   If you like sliders, this is the best place to go in scottsdale.
UNK:UNK It is what it is. No frills. Fine front desk staff and general cleanliness. I felt safe and the bed was comfortable. I'll tell ya - my favorite thing about this place is the bar Baer's Den at the end of the parking lot!   The breakfast should not be $10, it should be included! I did however have a fantastic breakfast sandwich at the Safeway right down the street!
UNK:UNK This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!
UNK:UNK Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.
UNK:UNK Excellent food! Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try. I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food. Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.
UNK:UNK Tasty, large portion, culinary delight appetizers.  More of a bar than a restaurant, but the food was good & trending artisanal.
UNK:UNK Located in the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Great sushi dishes and a great atmosphere.  I've only been there once but the service was great and the food was very taste and fresh.
UNK:UNK Teakwoods is the place to go if you are a "wings" fan!  They grill wings for crisp perfection and the flavor is so good that I don't even need ranch to dip the wing in.  I know - How can you not need ranch?  I didn't believe it until I tried it.    Everytime I go to a restaurant that offers wings, I will be comparing it to Teakwoods.
UNK:UNK Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  Definitely recommend coming here!
UNK:UNK Great place to shop for suits, ties, and dress clothes at reasonable prices.
UNK:UNK I was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.
UNK:UNK My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea
UNK:UNK very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable.
UNK:UNK We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back...
UNK:UNK The food isn't all that. I order an Ahi Salad, which was barely touched. On the other hand, the chicken Popsicle my friends ordered were quite delightful. all in all, that atmosphere was surely enjoyable.
UNK:UNK Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!
UNK:UNK I've only had a baguette once but never again, it almost made my gums bleed!  However, ever since they opened I've been a fan of their most delectable croissant sandwiches. Great prices and awesome drinks. Suckks they don't take card but still worth it.
UNK:UNK Great place to see a show.  Prices are the best around, and it's never too crowded.
UNK:UNK Wanna try it? Now is your chance! One more day of this LivingSocial deal: 12 days for $49  http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/453990?ref=email-jp&rpi=85154658
UNK:UNK If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket.
UNK:UNK Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
UNK:UNK I love this place. I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied. The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice. I'm so lucky to live down the street! Tons of vegan options, too.
UNK:UNK I like their chicago dog. It is delicious. I've had good service here because mostly the owners are almost always working and they are real nice. It's only when they are gone that you get the crummy service.
UNK:UNK I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard. They've completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic. They have made huge strives in their water skills. Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson.
UNK:UNK Nice location. Good outdoor dining. Moms Pot roast good and so are sausage ravioli. Interesting drinks an some local beers. I need to check out The Bliss Burger soon.
UNK:UNK You want to go to Four Peaks. Trust me.
UNK:UNK Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.
UNK:UNK Yummy, fast, fairly priced, and great service! I'll be back!!
UNK:UNK Surprisingly good!  I tried the strawberry lemonade and the caramel french toast.  Each had flavor through the cake and frosting, shockingly unusual to find in cupcakes, and plenty of frosting.  I will bring my sweet pea back for a treat.
UNK:UNK Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return.
UNK:UNK The fish tacos were good and the trendy atmosphere was nice. But, the whole thing was a bit too formula...like "restaurant in a box" concept. No outlyers, not much spice, fairly bland, middle of the road.....but wait, its in Arizona! Ok, no political jokes re Arizona. I was so-so with Blanco and will continue to explore on the next visit.
UNK:UNK Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again.
UNK:UNK First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the A's during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  What's not to like?
UNK:UNK I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again.
UNK:UNK There's just something about this place I don't like.  I love the wine list  I love dim lighting, caves, couches, sausage and cheese platters....  Just can't put my finger on it, but I would rather sit at the bar at Cowboy Ciao then have to hang out here.  *Shrug*  The bartenders were a bit snotty last time I was there... maybe that's it.  Hmph.
UNK:UNK Beatiful setting and good service. However, that doesn't make up for the $14 burger which was average at best and all three of ours were over cooked.
UNK:UNK OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food.
UNK:UNK Great outdoor patio, couches, big bar, tables, great burgers, huge side of crunchy fries and they carry sweet tea vodka.   Do not order the sangria, unless you like it super sweet. I don't, I'm sweet enough already.
UNK:UNK Awesome pizza! Wednesday half off bottles of wine is great for a ladies or date night. Nice bar and patio area.
UNK:UNK Best pizza ever! The crust is amazing. I recommend the magical mystery tour with chicken and a frosty local draft beer. Will be back.
UNK:UNK What Whattt! Hip hop videos blaring as I get my strike on? Bowling specials after 9pm? Friendly staff? Cheap drink specials from the bar in plastic cups? ASU and working class stiffs co-existing one sweaty bowling shoe at a time? Teenagers making out at the arcarde section?  Loooveeee you, Brunswick!
UNK:UNK Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.    I don't live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.
UNK:UNK Wow. Reading all these reviews makes UofP sound like a terrible, degree mill.  I am shocked! I have learned SO much which getting my MBA. The vast majority of my professors have been knowledgeable, available, and thorough. My peers have been inspiring and helpful.  When I graduate in June I know I will be leaving with much more than when I began.
UNK:UNK Outback is a great restaurant. You can count on the tasty food and good service. They are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product. This location gets busy during dinner time, but I've always had a good experience.
UNK:UNK Pretty damn expensive, but I don't think I could ever get sick of the teppenyaki!
UNK:UNK Excellent breakfast.  Portions were more than ample, service was attentive.  You could tell the place draws it's regulars, but it's a good option for visitors as well.  I had an egg sandwich on ciabatta bread, and my partner had pancakes.  We were both pleased.
UNK:UNK Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy  ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!
UNK:UNK Got a great deal from Home run.com and used it to find some good cigars. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable.
UNK:UNK Michael came out today and he was great! Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila! It seriously opens with 1 finger. He was quick, affordable, knowledgeable and very nice. Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind. A+!
UNK:UNK I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place.
UNK:UNK If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke.
UNK:UNK They serve alot of food.
UNK:UNK I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time.
UNK:UNK My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert. Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine. Great place to catch up with friends. I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up.
UNK:UNK Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.
UNK:UNK I will make this real easy for you.   Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.
UNK:UNK I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
UNK:UNK Nice, clean store, well-laid out, has all the traditional TJ stuff - lots of organics - although the fruits and veggies could be a bit better stocked.    Those little chocolate chip cookies are death to my diet - I cannot resist them.
UNK:UNK been coming here since birth
UNK:UNK This place is great but not if you have kids.  It mentioned on yelp that it is kids friendly, but they don't even have a table changer in their bathrooms.  I was there with my 2 year nephew and had to take him to the car to change his dirty diaper.  If you call a place kids friendly, you might think about accomodating and have a table changer in your bathrooms both in Potino and LGO.
UNK:UNK This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own.
UNK:UNK Because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living.  This valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans.
UNK:UNK It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!!
UNK:UNK There's the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like "its on me." and took it from his tips! I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that! I LOVE this place!! :D
UNK:UNK Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
UNK:UNK Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing.
UNK:UNK BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. They're newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!
UNK:UNK I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce, and it was unreal.  Cute little place.  I didn't sit to eat so I can't comment on the service, but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out.
UNK:UNK Fun trivia! Food is mediocre. Crowd was cool and there is plenty to do there (video games, darts etc..) When I'm back in Tempe visiting friends I know we'll be back. Bonus for having the misters and a great seating area outside. We met some very nice locals who were up for a good chat.
UNK:UNK Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)
UNK:UNK Tonight was great. I had a calzone, pepperoni and olive,  Coppola Zinfandel, the wife had a pizza with nice and hot jalapenos. The staff was nice, so much that we made comments to each other about the quality.
UNK:UNK Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap "bar" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!
UNK:UNK The mojitos are good and $13. Nice atmosphere. Still not the best service for a "5 diamond" property. The group we were with ordered about 6 servings of nice 15 yr old scotch (straight up) which they didn't have. They replaced it with 20 yr old at twice the price totaling $270. They really should have been made aware of the price first, they WEREN'T happy.
UNK:UNK Never busy when I go there at night. Very nice staff, good solid food, you got to love Filiberto's. I just wish they had a Drive-Thru! 2 Thumbs up for being very clean and friendly.
UNK:UNK While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.
UNK:UNK Awesome food and service!
UNK:UNK How did I not know this is right across the street from my house??  I woudn't describe myself as a crafter or DIYer, but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers, from traditional to fun and contemporary! I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from. The best part is that they were only $3.50!  They even sell Japanese Copic markers, take that Az art supply!
UNK:UNK Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!
UNK:UNK Delicious gourmet crepes. Friendly staff. Awesome environment. Price is right. Eat here, it's good.
UNK:UNK Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
UNK:UNK Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was "Oh!  We have a new supplier". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening.
UNK:UNK This is one of my favorite bars in the area.  The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive.  The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets.
UNK:UNK They do small engine repair here, so I took my lawn mower in.  It needed some attention -- a new carburetor, spark plug, bulb, and gasket.  Dropped it off in the morning and picked it up in the evening, very reasonable price.
UNK:UNK I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!
UNK:UNK In from out of town ..... Really glad we stopped here.... Excellent food nice atmosphere if I was planning to be in AZ more often I would bookmark this place.
UNK:UNK I ate so many samples, I downsized my order! Some selections are a little too sweet for me, but others--giarduia, vanilla, pistachio, that dark chocolate stuff--are really good! We rode our bikes there at night. Made up for the calories. You've gotta have a little wholesome, yummy sweetness in life now and then. OK, it's not Anderson's Frozen Custard, but it's fine for Chandler.
UNK:UNK Very impressed! $5 pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value. Free valet parking.  I look forward to coming back.
UNK:UNK This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)
UNK:UNK Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.  Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?
UNK:UNK -Biggest Joann's store  -Great fabric selection  -Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores)  -Convenient location (parking is not too bad).  -Employees are friendly.  -Restrooms are blah and smell.
UNK:UNK This place is cute, affordable, clean, and tasty. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch since the service is fairly quick and has a simple menu. Or you can bring your date here for a cute dinner date. The place is a fairly quiet place, and the lighting is very nice.
UNK:UNK This is a nice asian take-out style restaurant (you can order and sit down too). The portions are pretty big, and they have a good selection. WAAAAAAY better than Pei Wei which is in the same shopping center.   The only downside is their breading is a little heavy, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I have tried there.
UNK:UNK Today I went in for lunch and it seems the quality actually has gone down a bit it is still good pizza but the salad was a bit smaller and pizza just didn't have the same flavor.  You don't get that wood fired smoke taste which you would crave at a wood fired place.  I'll go back maybe today was a bad day as usually I like this place a lot.
UNK:UNK These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses.   We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!
UNK:UNK Grilled tofu sandwich was pretty good. Quiant little cafe with a lot of vegetarian options. :)
UNK:UNK Check engine light came on in Wikieup late on Friday night.  One of my family members has had work done here before and recommended them.  They got me in on short notice and stayed late to finish the job.  Was reasonably priced too.
UNK:UNK Sundae for Sunday.  Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
UNK:UNK This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars.
UNK:UNK As a mom of two, Jason's Deli is awesome.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy, and the kid's meals are huge and priced right. For my young kids (4 and 2), one meal is enough for them to share. For bigger kids, it seems they could be eating off the kid's meal longer than at some places.  Add speedy delivery of food and free self-serve ice cream at the end, and this is one happy mom!
UNK:UNK Earl's is Earl's - not great - not bad. If you're in the neighborhood and don't have anywhere else to go, go to Earl's. By far there are better choices, but Earl's will do when you're in a pinch.  Typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable.   The staff is very friendly and the service is very good.   Just average, not memorable.
UNK:UNK Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though
UNK:UNK Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend
UNK:UNK Nello's is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place.  You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order.
UNK:UNK When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements. It was marvelous. The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation. They lasted for weeks. I am really pleased with this company and wouldn't hesitate to use them again!
UNK:UNK Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends
UNK:UNK Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
UNK:UNK Best gyros I've had in the East Valley so far.  The place is nice, but the service was very slow when I went there with a group of people for lunch.  It was my first time there, and maybe I caught them on a bad day?  I'll definitely be back again...
UNK:UNK A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I loved the design of the restaurant and was so excited to try the food. The menu isn't large at all but there is great substance in their offerings. I had the chili lime chicken which was really delicious. I don't think I managed to eat even half of my order but it made for great leftovers. :)  I noticed they had a very reasonable take out menu too!
UNK:UNK "6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles".  Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.
UNK:UNK I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.
UNK:UNK Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy.   I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!
UNK:UNK Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged! Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat! If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!
UNK:UNK Humdinger!   What more is there to say.  It's the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town.
UNK:UNK Based on the reviews from some of the people, I would have to disagree. The gelato is not that great. I'm a little perplexed by the near unanimous 5 stars. I seriously don't think these people in Phoenix haven't ventured past AZ state border. I've had gelato here, and I thought I was eating Coldstone.
UNK:UNK Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then.  Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right.  I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. I'm looking forward to it.
UNK:UNK mid-afternoon is definitely different than dinner. still tasted good.  we usually get the layered dip, it's totally messy and not as good as i think it should be, but i like it anyhow.  i get the durango burro and matt gets some combo monstrosity.  service is...meh, average. queso is tasty.
UNK:UNK Its was just OK! Liked the fresh jalapenos option, fries hardly had seasoning, was a bit pricey, but filling.  Free peanuts, but wasn't sure if it was ok to throw on the floor. They use the same color scheme as In N Out which I thought was humerous.  I'll still give it another try in a few months.
UNK:UNK He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive.
UNK:UNK pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.
UNK:UNK Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
UNK:UNK The "Cheers" of central Phoenix.
UNK:UNK I think I went the wrong way, but I ended up doing a very isolated trail that wasn't too scenic, but at least it was quiet.  It sort of just "ended" though and didn't wrap around.  So then I walked the same way back which was kind of boring.  I like trails that are on loops.
UNK:UNK Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!
UNK:UNK Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.    The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent.   You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.     I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).
UNK:UNK I rather go to Native or Zipps... We have had bad expierence after bad expierence here. If you are craving wings, this isn't the spot for you.
UNK:UNK This park is always a pleasant experience.  Honey and I like to drop by the dog park and then take a walk and make a big loop around the lake.  It isn't the greenest park in Phoenix by any stretch of the imagination, but it does offer a pretty nice view and lots of space to enjoy the outdoors.
UNK:UNK Foodie from Cali here on business. Nicely done dishes with authentic flavor. Ling Shrimp to die for - at ridiculous bargain prices. 5 stars if they expand menu. Very nice family setting.
UNK:UNK Like this location, fairly close to my house and open late. Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh dogs, I jet over here. Highly  recommend their  ALL BEEF mustard and chili dogs. Check out the fries too, super salty, always fresh and leave you wanting more! Not a big fan of their pretzel or corn dogs- expect a little bit of wait, perfect hot dogs don't take minutes to make!
UNK:UNK Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.
UNK:UNK Love Sam's Club! Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine ... the best! We always do most of our grocery shopping here. Always a treat.
UNK:UNK Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.
UNK:UNK Breakfast. The best crispy chicken fried steak and eggs this side of Texas. Served with country gravy, hash browns and garnished with a slice of cantaloupe and honey dew melon for under $7. The green chili cheese burger is also one of my favorites, served any time of day or night. Only down side is getting past all the unwashed morons gambling and chain smoking cigarettes.
UNK:UNK Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for "account inactivity" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.  It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.   Account closed.
UNK:UNK Can't wait to go here again. Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding. I'll write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious.
UNK:UNK Reviews are dead on good food good service in a little bit of a strange out of the way location.
UNK:UNK If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.
UNK:UNK RIP  I drive by here every day but looked over and saw the place dark inside and the signage ripped down. They never did quite recover from the roof collapse thing. Was the only Vietnamese place by my work, now sadly, there are none. They should have offered Banh Mi for lunch. Woulda-coulda-shoulda.
UNK:UNK A very inadequate meal and expensive for the low quality food you get.  Ordered the veal sorrentino and it was not enjoyable to eat.  Very dry, tough...just gross.  Caesar salad was also disgusting and unpleasant, saturated in dressing.  I did like the atmosphere, laid back and comfortable.  Knowing that Pasta Brioni is down the street, I won't go back.
UNK:UNK Staff is nice, and that's it. They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.
UNK:UNK I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!   Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.
UNK:UNK Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.
UNK:UNK Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy.
UNK:UNK The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much.
UNK:UNK My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!
UNK:UNK Tonight I finally tried this place. I went during happy hour (unknowingly) so I was VERY happy to see that drinks were 2-4-1. WOOT! What a great deal. I ordered a half and half order of their spicy and cinnamon fries. My God they were tasty! I LOVED the decor here too. Only 4 stars because I didn't really get to try the food, but it definitely had me intrigued. I will be back, Fez!
UNK:UNK Coconut and carrey heaven
UNK:UNK Good boutique hotel with nice amenities. Clean and contemporary I'd definitely stay here again!
UNK:UNK burnt. china china caught fire :(
UNK:UNK I go here a lot. Well...used to. Service gets worse and worse. Food isn't as good as it once was. Happy hour is amazing though!
UNK:UNK Great, fun atomosphere! Service was great! My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.  Average prices but great value! Highly recommend this place for date night!
UNK:UNK I've played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US. We're lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard. This course stands out! Exemplary service, and the driving range is the best I've ever seen.  The course is tough. No country club rolls here. Hit it right or left and you're undoubtedly taking a drop, and a stroke.  Can't wait to get back for my next round!
UNK:UNK we had the back door pizza for a village and in a word...yuck.  i think the spinach was frozen and not fresh, the prosciutto had an unusual bitterness or was it the sauce? we also paid 8 bucks for two tins of lettuce with either bland dressing on one or little to no dressing on the other and maybe a few shavings of cheese.  soooo not worth the money.
UNK:UNK Ordered the Philly Egg Rolls. They came out still frozen in the middle. It's hit or miss if the waitress will be decent or not.
UNK:UNK I didn't think my experience staying there was as bad as previous yelp reviewers...my stay was short, but, quiet and nice...service was good, and I had a restful night, the only thing I probably will suggest is,turn off the A/C before you go to sleep, that helps a lot (not summer season I mean)...
UNK:UNK The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
UNK:UNK The best burgers in town at a fast food restaurant. Cajun fries are tasty too. They have the coolest soda dispenser at this location. Hey, I never knew they had Orange and Rasberry Diet Coke.
UNK:UNK LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.
UNK:UNK I LOVE the Bacado. There is nothing better for nursing a hangover than the Good Egg.   We try to visit every few weeks. Yes, the wait for a table can be long, but it's totally worth it!
UNK:UNK I hate walking in here because it always stinks.  They really need to ventilate this place.  My daughter loves it, always had a great time, whether she is skating or attending Club 54.  Great place for birthday parties, she loved her party.  She also got a butt-load of tokens with the party package.
UNK:UNK Mixteca was OK. Kind of a cross between Baja Fresh and Robertos. The quesadilla was decent and the beef tacos were good also, just nothing spectacular. I would go up the street to "Carumbas" for something better. Doesn't accept AMEX:(
UNK:UNK This is a great alternative to national chains.  Great pizza at a great price and usually a coupon is readily available.  This location is no frills and the salad bar is basically extra pizza toppings. Yet its always clean and the staff is normally friendly even when phone swamped.  Barros won't knock your socks off but it always has great, wallet friendly pizza pie.
UNK:UNK This place has some EXCELLENT, LARGE, and MEATY burritos.  They also have some pretty good horchata, and nice tortas (sandwiches).  If you're looking for a drive-through, or are willing to eat outside, then Filiberto's is a great place to get some food.
UNK:UNK Bit over priced, but they're tea is to die for!
UNK:UNK ***** The service was fantastic, There was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the Gelato was awesome as always!!!  ** Yummy Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie!! :)
UNK:UNK Best ribs in Arizona (besides my own)!!
UNK:UNK We've been going here for years. Love the food (Happy Family is a favorite dish) and appreciate the community service outreach. Great to support locals who support the community ... and dish up great food along the way.
UNK:UNK mmmmm - wine  mmmmmm - beer  mmmmmm - well yes, I am a lush and this is lush heaven!  Thanks Bevmo.  Only one not great experience here and it was customer service orientated, let's just say there is a lot to know about wine and just because someone is in flip-flops doesn't mean they want a $5 bottle...
UNK:UNK Dangerous place to shop!  Lots of neat imported goodies, many in sample sizes so you can try them out before buying the bigger size.  I got about 6 different flavors of hot cocoa, a maple sugar candy in a maple leaf shape for me (Michigan thing), and filed away a lot of ideas for gift-buying when I get home.  I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!
UNK:UNK We had my husband's birthday party here.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  They made everything easy! Our friends loved the place and the band (ReGroove) and had a wonderful time.  Drinks are well-priced and very generous.  The owners and staff truly want customers to be happy, comfortable, stress-free and to have a good time!!
UNK:UNK Loved it. Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding. ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway. It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K.
UNK:UNK While Calabria Italian Kitchen & Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED.
UNK:UNK Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!
UNK:UNK I thought it was ok, hubby thought it was spectacular.  I tried to order my standard soy vanilla latte but they were out of vanilla - to me that's like a hamburger joint being out of ketchup.  So I got a mocha instead - nice coffee flavor, but the chocolate didn't taste so special.  Hubby had a cappuccino and would definitely get it again.
UNK:UNK I LOVE DIlly's! I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup, which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy!
UNK:UNK I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain.
UNK:UNK It's difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings.  We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back.
UNK:UNK Food was decent, smaller portions which is GOOD, friendly service. Not the cleanest but a decent meal with good prices. It would get 4 stars if the food had just a little more flavor.
UNK:UNK This Chili's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and it's crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chili's here.
UNK:UNK Wow this place is great. The whole atmosphere is unique. Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea. Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane.
UNK:UNK Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!
UNK:UNK Good food and great service.  Staff is very friendly and attentive without hovering.  I would definitely go back
UNK:UNK Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!
UNK:UNK My house is clean using pet-friendly products.  They arrive on time.  I know that some of the reviews talk about having trouble reaching them by phone, but I have never had a problem reaching them by email (which I prefer).  The ladies show up, work quickly and efficiently, and are on their way.  I couldn't be happier.
UNK:UNK I am changing my review - lately because of bad economy, they are not getting enough customers, their food quality has gone down. I won't waste my time or money on this.
UNK:UNK It was consistently the best carne adobada, now consistency is the one thing they don't have. Beer selection, menu, wait staff and most importantly quality seem to change every time I'm in. Please figure it out soon...
UNK:UNK Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotle's yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion. The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!
UNK:UNK Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?
UNK:UNK The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. That's the direction I recommend if you come here.
UNK:UNK Coffee is pretty good, but, well, I wasn't thrilled with the ambiance, or the barista. The first time I went, they were having a shift change and forgot to make our drinks. The second, the Batista was kinda brusque. Also, I agree with H C's comments... I walked in and everyone stopped and stared...not great ambiance,but good coffee.
UNK:UNK MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!!   Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.  The patio area is nice all year round.
UNK:UNK Closed?  Really?  It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open.  Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer.  We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that they're done.  What a shame.
UNK:UNK For mall food this place is great. Love the pitas, rice, and yummy potatoes.
UNK:UNK One of the few legit brewpubs around.
UNK:UNK Great service and delicious breakfasts!
UNK:UNK Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!
UNK:UNK Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!!  My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!
UNK:UNK We only come here for the water and in that regard there are no complaints about this place.  There is no chlorine smell, faucets are all fast and the guys find your water card fast.
UNK:UNK Buffalo Exchange aims to be a cool thrift store with only stuff people would actually want to buy. Although they succeeded, the prices aren't really at all close to thrift store prices. They have some unique things but I wouldn't go in there expecting to get a great deal. If you are feeling thrifty stick to Savers or Goodwill, and treat Buffalo Exchange as a regular shopping experience.
UNK:UNK My picks: Derby Smash Green Chili Risotto Pan Seared Escolar Sticky Buns  If you are looking for Arizona charm, this is the place. Every Arizona resident needs to experience this hidden gem.  Thanks Jacquie, Kristy & Tim for continuing to believe in this historic restaurant and landmark!
UNK:UNK The margarita pizza is awesome. They use a delicious red sauce that I would be happy to eat on noodles- much different than a lot of pizza places that just use a tasteless red goo. Good crust too! The organic root beer is pretty gross though.
UNK:UNK We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
UNK:UNK Awesome!!!
UNK:UNK charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too.   They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it!  yay for charlestons!
UNK:UNK What's better than some refreshing, authentic Italian ice on a 115 degree day? Not much. Good variety of flavors, friendly owners, and a nice space. Enough said.
UNK:UNK They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help.
UNK:UNK I absolutely love the food here! the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..I can't complain. this is one of favorite places to eat.
UNK:UNK Wife loved the ribs, BBQ chicken was ok. Service was awesome!  We were served by trainee Dawn being trained by Samantha. They were very fun!
UNK:UNK Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied!   Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!
UNK:UNK Location is key to this place.  Sitting on the street side patio offers great people watching opportunities.  An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast. The food was good, bacon had some spice! Potatoes were slightly undercooked, but the flavored coating masked it.   The granola was a honey crunch granola which was enjoyable.
UNK:UNK This place is for purists!  Be prepared for a great deal of questionable textured items if you order the tasting...Great sushi and sashimi however I would go to sakana sushi & grill for a true sashimi / sushi experience.
UNK:UNK I absolutely love this place!  I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.  Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Worth the drive to downtown!
UNK:UNK A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!
UNK:UNK The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order.
UNK:UNK I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)  P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
UNK:UNK Just spent two years in Austin eating BBQ from all over the state.  This place is legit.....for Phoenix.  WORLD CLASS sausage and excellent brisket!    Sides were average.  Nothing much exciting there.  The bread was killing both me and the quality of the meat.  The sauce is too sweet.  It would be great for St. Louis style ribs, but this is Texas...put some spice in there.
UNK:UNK Worked around the corner for about a year anticipating this place opening. Finally got to stop in for coffee this morning (a year later) and had a piping hot Americano and a mango-poppyseed muffin. Big fan so far! Looking forward to having coffee on the patio when it's a bit cooler.
UNK:UNK Had a great time, very family friendly!
UNK:UNK Place is clean, staff is friendly...I love that it's kind of a one stop shop and the self serve yogurt shop connects to the water and ice next door.  You can get what ever cold confection you are craving from Thrifty's ice cream, shaved ice, yogurt or smoothies...an added bonus is they stay open late 7 days a week!
UNK:UNK My husband and I loved it.  The food was delicious. The ambiance very comfortable and child friendly.  I needed to dip my fries in something other than ketchup so they came over and asked what they could whip up for me. Who does that?  She brought out a yummy, very hot :) honey mustard. They should offer it on the menu. You can also make reservations here on opentable.com
UNK:UNK Great service
UNK:UNK Best burger I've ever had, and a great view from the patio.  Enjoyed a wonderful date with my husband there.
UNK:UNK I was thrilled to find my room huge, sheets crisp and clean, and the staff super friendly.
UNK:UNK Simple, well prepared food. Not the cheapest sandwich shop, but it is consistently high quality. The best part is the bread. It's all good, but I especially like the ciabatta. And being next to changing hands and trader joe's doesn't hurt!  Some favorites:  Chicken continental, sweet potato sandwich for something different, roast beef and gorgonzola.
UNK:UNK Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!
UNK:UNK This place is great.  I met up with a friend there for drinks after work.  I love the bar which has a garage type door that opens up so you can sit outside or inside.  Great intimate vibe outside under a big tree with lights.  Great warm vibe inside.  Great mix of basics and mexi-cali items like ceviche and tacos and burgers and mac and cheese.
UNK:UNK gotta be honest, i'm not a wine drinker, but came here to meet up with friends for a tasting. the space is sleek, yet cozy. the staff is friendly and very earnest and knowledgable in their wine presentation.
UNK:UNK This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it. I love coming here on special occasions!
UNK:UNK We have tried this spot a few times and each visit we find just enough we like to keep coming back.  The whitefish on bialy is a favorite and the selection of bagels is extensive.  Try an oversized sandwich with a vanilla phosphate... All wonderful.  The only downside is that most items are $10+ and that adds up for a family of 5.
UNK:UNK Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.
UNK:UNK Cool place in downtown!  I've been to all of the iterations of the restaurant and all of them have been pretty cool.  The happy hour is a great deal and the bartenders are really nice.
UNK:UNK Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.
UNK:UNK One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.
UNK:UNK Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable. I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms! I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.  While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in.
UNK:UNK I love this quiet location right of I-10.  Their selection is exactly as reported online, and the online orders I placed are always ready for pickup when they are supposed to be.  Parking is wide open, service is good, and the area isn't overpopulated yet so it's always relatively quiet here.
UNK:UNK Met for a business meeting, good happy hour menu, we had the flatbread which was great to share over our meeting with some of their house bread, which was excellent with the pesto.  The well whiskey was poured nicely and our server was nice.  Great for happy hour biz meetings on the waterfront, but only 3 tables in the bar, so you better get there early.
UNK:UNK Over priced.  Mediocre food.  Service so so. We won't be returning.
UNK:UNK A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank.
UNK:UNK Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!
UNK:UNK Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious.
UNK:UNK I am in town visiting and stopped at Shea for lunch. I actually had a breakfast sandwich/bagel even though it was 1pm (they said you can have breakfast anytime!).  The service was great and it was very cute inside. There are tables and they have free wi-fi so it would be a great place to meet clients for a casual meeting. They also have a drive-thru if you want to grab a quick cup of coffee.
UNK:UNK Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!
UNK:UNK are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip.
UNK:UNK modified is a great place to see a show.  it almost reminds me of basement shows back home- intimate, smelly, people utterly engrossed in the music, all ages.  it's good stuff.
UNK:UNK TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!
UNK:UNK We had fun but it is definately more for kids 5 and younger .  The pretend store was fun and we all had a blast playing in the noodles.
UNK:UNK "Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop." Heaven!!
UNK:UNK Valle is all about the ritas happy hour, chips and bean dip and an awesome patio, if you are looking to eat awesome pollo funditos well they have that too...
UNK:UNK This place is kind of foreboding to enter... it just looks like a dimly lit house. But I had heard good things and went a few nights ago and it was adorable! It's like a bar in your living room. They have endless selections of beer and it's a fun environment. I definitely want to go back when there is a show going on as well. My only complaint is that there's no beer on tap!
UNK:UNK This is a super cute restaurant with a simple yet delicious menu. They stick to basics which I love. They also have a vintage items that you can admire and purchase. Its a great place if you want a quick, simple, cheap yet delicious meal. Their shakes are amazing as well as their potato salad. YUM! If you are in the area, check it our for sure!
UNK:UNK Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.
UNK:UNK Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want. Small but worth it.
UNK:UNK Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!
UNK:UNK The BEST brewery I've ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!
UNK:UNK I haven't been here in quite a while, but when I was coming here, they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers (their name is The Latest, though I don't think they play here anymore). The place is totally trendy, but I really see that as a good thing here.
UNK:UNK burgers were terribly unoriginal.  french fries came strait out of the safeway freezer section.  the guy working was so hungover it was kind of sad to watch.
UNK:UNK Good, but not as good as Ocean Club.  The new location is fantastic, and there is nothing to complain about here, but I'd rather dine at Mastro's.
UNK:UNK Great food! Good prices.
UNK:UNK i love this place. i can always spent all my money here on something.  they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too. the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly. Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy.
UNK:UNK Great martini's and they even have Absynthe if you're looking to get crazy. Great looking modern style bar and lounge.
UNK:UNK Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad.
UNK:UNK Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.     It's by far my favorite pizza place.   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.     Sounds good to me.
UNK:UNK If you like a good burger then check this place out. They have so many options that you can choose from to make your own burger. I am usually not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these ones come with a dipping sauce that is amazing.
UNK:UNK This is the only music store on my side of town and since I never can buy online early enough, is where I usually buy my reeds. The customer service is great and they appear to have a huge selection of almost everything a music student should need.
UNK:UNK Clean, clean, clean! Everything about this place was spotless. The food itself was perfectly adapted to suburban American tastes. Somehow even the Sweet & Sour chicken seemed.. extra clean. ::)
UNK:UNK was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when it's a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!
UNK:UNK I love this place, that is, the selection and randomness of the food. However, the prices I'm not so keen on.  My sugar snap peas were the same as Safeway and were fresh, so I'm sold on that.  It's also the only place I can find my Kettle brand chips in the flavor I crave, so I'm sold on that too.  Now if only the prices could reach my income level, that'd be stellar.
UNK:UNK My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas' airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!
UNK:UNK i'd rather go to amado's!  the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say.
UNK:UNK This is a huge store and love that the clothes were sized.  There is a separate room for housewares and a bit messy.  Some of the housewares stuff was dirty but great deals. They were running a 50% sale on all items in the store, blue, red or white.  Own parking lot.
UNK:UNK Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz.
UNK:UNK Grocery store was within walking distance for my hotel stay. Picked up my food stash for my visit.
UNK:UNK Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for 2 for 20.00!
UNK:UNK Just o.k.  We had the Italian Stallion, it tasted very good, but between 2 adults left us pretty hungry.  For 14 dollars, it seemed to be more of an appetizer.
UNK:UNK 4 stars because they don't take credit cards. Really? In this day and age?  Yogurt and shakes were good, but not the best I've ever had, but a solid 4 stars.
UNK:UNK TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it.  Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl!  TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...
UNK:UNK Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.        "
UNK:UNK I really like this store.  The customer service is great.  I wish it weren't so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.
UNK:UNK Intense!
UNK:UNK Very much my kind of a place, it reminded me of the places in Europe/Berlin that I loved so much. Its like a house setting & on the days that we went they had a live band playing great fusion stuff in the back rooms. Their Beer collection is amazing of course, one of the few places in Phoenix with such a huge beer collection.
UNK:UNK A great little spot to find! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats! Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!
UNK:UNK I like this Sam's. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. It's almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They don't have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but I've never waited in line here.
UNK:UNK Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast. What a deal. Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!
UNK:UNK I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!  They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.  My skin has never looked better!  I am very pleased.
UNK:UNK Had a fantastic experience! Hernan, our server was excellent. Knowledgable and charming. The food was fantastic. The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane. Crazy flavor. Well done!
UNK:UNK I really like this place!  I was surprised to see the other rating with one star.  I have been 3 times in the last 2 months- always for lunch and ordered off the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and neat, and our food has always been fresh, hot and yes, "simple"- but really good.  You don't feel overly full (take the rest to go) and it's not greasy or heavy.  Good stuff.
UNK:UNK Great menu selection, food is hot and fresh and you can't beat the prices!
UNK:UNK I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.  Very happy with the service.  Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut.
UNK:UNK One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)
UNK:UNK This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of "cuisine". I have to say the foo d wasn't bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry.
UNK:UNK What can I say? Like the rest of joes restaurants, this place is great! Keep them coming Joe!
UNK:UNK I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there aren't many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza.
UNK:UNK Roast beef sandwich at lunch is literally the best I've had. Cooked to order. Had mine rare.
UNK:UNK Stopped in, had a couple of drinks, paid and left. Nothing to get excited over, but a decent stop if you like Irish whiskey and need a fix.
UNK:UNK We recently tried this place, during lunch.  The crunchy tacos are really good.  The rice and beans are so so.  Haven't tried the Ritas yet.
UNK:UNK One word can describe the food here:  perfection.  All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.  Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him . . . I can't wait to taste that dish!
UNK:UNK My wife stayed here while transitioning to Arizona and enjoyed her stay. The hotel seems modern and they are currently renovating the place; so far so good with the improvements.
UNK:UNK Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner.
UNK:UNK White tank is still an excellent place to hike. I hadn't been here in about 8 years. I was really shocked to see all the new construction near the entrance. A shame really.   The flowers were in bloom, so that was a bonus for sure.
UNK:UNK Glorified Applebee's. I think they want the yard of beer to cover the lack luster food & services.
UNK:UNK Went to this place on the recommendation of a friend and definitely wasn't disappointed.  The burgers were GREAT and the music was perfect for the time of day.  There was a good crowd and the staff was very friendly.  I would deinitely hit up this place the next time I am in AZ.
UNK:UNK If not for the aircraft landing and taking off, you'd be crazy to eat here.  Prices are about the same as Denney's. Cleanliness, really needs to be improved. Wait Staff, isn't very efficient.   Apart from the menu, they do offer a Sunday Breakfast Brunch.
UNK:UNK Stayed at the hotel from 11/18 till 11/23/12. Excellent hotel and the stuff was great. Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn't fly out as I was affected by the storm.. The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn't even change the price. Everything was great. The room was clean. The pool was excellent.
UNK:UNK Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
UNK:UNK Have to agree with Timmy... located just off the 51, it does have a Roadhouse feel to it...  Haven't been there for dinner, but the combination Texas/Arizona (hence the name) cuisine is pretty good fare...
UNK:UNK Kaley helped me get the best room in Mesa AZ, my view was awesome. The beds were clean, and the service was awesome, with a great cafe style restaurant. I am recommending to all my friends to call Kaley for a hook up!
UNK:UNK Fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in. This is NM Cafe!  Popovers. Prawn and avocado salad. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  Make your reservation under Candy Spelling's name. You will get the BEST table.   Works every time.
UNK:UNK Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
UNK:UNK Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though.
UNK:UNK I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.  I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.
UNK:UNK I took the pole dance aerobics class last night, and man am i feeling it today! everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me, as ive never tried this kind of thing before. it's tucked away, and at first i had no clue where it was, but its worth the search! had a blast, got a great work out, and felt great afterwards, im definitely going back for more!!!
UNK:UNK Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices! We will definitely be back! Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!
UNK:UNK I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.
UNK:UNK This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!
UNK:UNK Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago.   There still might be someone in line tho...
UNK:UNK I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.
UNK:UNK Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always! This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries. I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
UNK:UNK I think they do a pretty good job here.   I appreciate the doc's frankness.
UNK:UNK such a confusing airport
UNK:UNK I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth.
UNK:UNK Relatively inexpensive, good solid mexican food place. I wouldn't drive 5 miles for it, but its a lifesaver if you live nearby. Better than the 'bertos.
UNK:UNK Good food, decent selection, open late (for you partiers), decent delivery time.
UNK:UNK Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!
UNK:UNK Fine for an overnight at the airport. Not a vacation destination. Needs a full restoration. Breakfast included.
UNK:UNK Great egg drop soup.  Kung pao chicken - meh.  Beef broccoli - yum.
UNK:UNK this place is awesome. GO. & soon - already decent wait times.   OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks. yeah, yeah. shut up.  GO GO GO.
UNK:UNK I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
UNK:UNK This place was once known as J Chew and Company. I loved that place and this new version is still great.  So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best.
UNK:UNK Friendly atmosphere, cool decor, good iced tea and iced chai, great bagels and tasty cupcakes!  I had some trouble logging onto their WiFi, but my computer tends to be petulant.
UNK:UNK Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof.
UNK:UNK I'm a fan of J.T.'s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  It's small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. 's is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery.
UNK:UNK This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!  The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.  Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!  A must visit!
UNK:UNK Great quality food, atmosphere, and location. This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food. The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing. Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend..
UNK:UNK best breakfeast downtown ... bar none ... it's far more "healthy" than I traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful, very cool and has an ADORABLE waitress ;) !!!!
UNK:UNK oh these wings were freaking amaaizizznzng,  el heffe i believe they were... the bartender seemed very cool and concerened on what i was getting.. great suggestions.
UNK:UNK Is Jimmy single?  Cause if he is, I'd like to introduce myself.  Nice local Italian spot.    Decent prices.  Friendly service.   Antipasta salad was great, lots of goodies for the money.  Meatballs and Italian sausage were okay bu the spicy sauce was great.  I will be back to try the pizza, get another salad and ask if Jimmy is around.
UNK:UNK Good food and good service in a convenient location to South Mountain.  Great place for a weekend breakfast!
UNK:UNK If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.
UNK:UNK I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast
UNK:UNK Hybrid class!! Did it a few years back and to this day it's the best workout I've ever had. Will be going back FOR SURE
UNK:UNK Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the "always busy" Paradise Bakery.   Good prices (about $1-2 less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place.  I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon.
UNK:UNK Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it.
UNK:UNK Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!
UNK:UNK I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.  Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!  This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!
UNK:UNK Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye..
UNK:UNK The pancakes would be a 5, but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so I averaged it out to a 4 star.  A very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast.  You can order just 1 if you want, perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes!!!!
UNK:UNK Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!
UNK:UNK Always clean and accommodating to any workout schedule.  I work near by so it is very convenient to go at lunch.  Great amenities, even a pool, and classes.  Wish there were a few more yoga classes or classes geared to those of us that are out of shape/beginners, but I'll get there.
UNK:UNK I love this place, I want to go to Arizona just to eat here!  The greek fries were really good and different.  It was just really really good.   We're going next time I'm in town Fervor!
UNK:UNK Super cheap and good! I loved how large the portions were, the squid salad came in a large bowl and was delicious. We will definitely be returning.
UNK:UNK How can something so simple taste sooo good? I wish there were one more on the west side. I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread. There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix! As Rachel Ray would say, "Yummy!"
UNK:UNK I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore.
UNK:UNK This is one of my favorite theaters.    It's a little known fact that the first showing of the day for any film is only $5.  This keeps my wife and I coming back.  One of our favorite things is to see a movie at 9am and hit a great spot for brunch afterwards.  And yes, they don't mind when you show up in pajamas with Starbucks.  A great time!
UNK:UNK This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience. The place was packed and yet they got me in right away. A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job. They even put on a timer for 15 mins to ensure I got a full massage during it. They offered the other services but did not force any on me. I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others.
UNK:UNK The best staff around! Very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied with your food. The food is great as well. From breakfast to lunch, and healthy shakes like Fast Fuel, you can get it here. Very clean too!
UNK:UNK Im a sucker for great libations and the stores that can carry the works.. Zinfandel for me.. Magners for my boy.. ( a great Irish cider we fell in love with in SF).. great tequilas.. all types of wines.. you get my sniffster...
UNK:UNK Wow! The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!! The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day. I will definitely be back! The Thai Tea was very good also. I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!
UNK:UNK Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!
UNK:UNK I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!  One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa.
UNK:UNK I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.  Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
UNK:UNK its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name-  ONE STOP DRINK SHOP!  HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable!
UNK:UNK I came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner.  I'm glad I made that short walk to here because I enjoyed eating their prime rib.  It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel.
UNK:UNK As a NY'er...I can tell you this pizza isn't THAT good...and it's inconsistent. I like Ray's far better.
UNK:UNK Very typical mexican food. nothing special.
UNK:UNK Great down and dirty Mexican. Chips 1st quality: substantial. Salsas tasty and spicy. Chicken Victoria tender. Didn't have, but the Sopapillas look awesome. Fun colorful atmosphere, good mex music.
UNK:UNK Oh....my 2am delivery staple.  Their "til 3am delivery" feature is one of the beauties of Silver Mine. Their sandwiches are always fresh and these people are fast. The Dodge City w/ a side of chili is my go to. So, so good.
UNK:UNK I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.  Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.
UNK:UNK Let's cut the witty intro and get right down to the awesome food recommendations:  Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ... AWESOME! Hummus with Chicken ... AWESOME and filling! Spinach and 4 Cheese Quesadilla ... TASTY!  Just go there. Go for lunch with a bunch of people on a sunny day and sit outside near the lake/pond. Go for dinner on a first date with a cute girl. Just go there.
UNK:UNK Waitress/ bartenders are cute. We didnt eat. We just got a drink and left. Only like 5 beers on tap but no worries. They even gave one of my friends a band-aid lol. Their mix drink prices are a bit outrageous tho.. 3 beers for 10 or so.. 15 alone for a double of jack and coke.
UNK:UNK Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!
UNK:UNK Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines. Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night
UNK:UNK Great help!
UNK:UNK My food was delicious and the waitress were nice! They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal. Spicy does mean spicy here though!
UNK:UNK Amazing facility. Scottsdale healthcare has done a great job, the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals. They are very receptive and the ER operates like clockwork.
UNK:UNK The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!
UNK:UNK I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.
UNK:UNK No credit, weird layout,  not much fresh food
UNK:UNK if a hipster bar met a dive bar, this would be their offspring!  good music and lots of kinds of friendly people!
UNK:UNK It's a freeway.  Traffic sucks near downtown but the views are nice through Dreamy Draw.  I think I just saw Kurdy passing by!
UNK:UNK Very good Rubio's, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and don't have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean.
UNK:UNK Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work.  The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd.  Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full.
UNK:UNK just another big store with everything everywhere.
UNK:UNK This is my favorite place to go for Greek food. The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present.  The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service. I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive.
UNK:UNK I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.
UNK:UNK decent.  the potstickers were kind of good.  I didn't really know what to expect.  it met my expectation.  the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping.  the selection was impressive.  and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing.  spam, was it?  some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise.
UNK:UNK Had a terrific Breakfast Sunday morning with my niece from Los Angles. Great Breakfast Burrito, Outstanding Blueberry Whiskey Cake. Staff was so friendly, Service was great. Will bring all my friends and guest there. Enjoy!
UNK:UNK Huge store, friendly staff
UNK:UNK Good stuff! Reminds me of a small pho place in San Jose I used to go to almost everyday for a while.  The pho is very good. Not the absolute best, but very good. Their fresh spring rolls are excellent as well. Cool, crisp and tasty. I also like their sandwiches as well, but could do without the tomato in them. Kind of strange.
UNK:UNK My car looks better than it did the day I bought it!
UNK:UNK OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.
UNK:UNK Always treat me well, very honest!!
UNK:UNK One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar.   The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now.   Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.
UNK:UNK Great atmosphere and food. We keep coming back!
UNK:UNK Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition
UNK:UNK Got there at 11am on a Sunday, it was packed to the gills. WOW! I should have listened to Michele M. We ordered shrimp dumplings, roasted pork, bbq steamed buns, turnip cakes, shrimp egg rolls, chicken feet, spare ribs, steam sticky rice with meats, fried tofu, egg tarts, etc... Everything was good. This is the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix.
UNK:UNK I've been going here many years.  The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.  I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.
UNK:UNK The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway.
UNK:UNK omg... I love this place the food is great, the selection is great, the staff is very helpful. This  is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry.
UNK:UNK I love this place.  The family is very sweet and the food is real deal homecooked Cuban food ... as good as I remember eating in Havana.  I love the Fricase de Pollo and my hubby loves the oxtail.  The fruit juices/smoothies are delish too!
UNK:UNK In short... great view, really expensive food.
UNK:UNK I love Rubios. I can't really help it. The fish tacos with some lime and a Corona just hits the spot sometimes. I'd recommend it over any of the other restaurants on this particular strip in Surprise.  Edit: Now closed.
UNK:UNK Ok seriously I don't miss Arizona but I sure in the hell miss this place. I daydream about this place....I miss everything on the menu because trust me I tried it...I was a hungry pregnant women on the prawl....besides I loved the live music and the hummus was out of this WORLD!!!  If you haven't gone....go you won't regret it...It's one of the few things about Arizona I miss.....
UNK:UNK Over-priced, over-crowded and every time I have been there...it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini! But if you are looking to 'people watch' this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance  with an open area overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust-system isnt strong enough for the Teppan tables because I smell like heavy fried food when I leave!!
UNK:UNK I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.  Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!  Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!
UNK:UNK Johnnie's Garbage dog is the work of the God's. You can't go wrong with any of the dog's here so when you can't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all! Seriously try this one.   Be forewarned it can be messy, so get a good grip because once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.
UNK:UNK Food-  Amazing nachos!  Best i've ever had.  Plenty of toppings, well worth the 9 dollars  Service-The guy behind the counter is very nice and makes excellent suggestions and remembers me every time I come in and asks how his suggestion panned out!  Ambiance-Nice little spot, nothing fancy
UNK:UNK I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.  I need to come back and get the pizza!
UNK:UNK All around great.  Great food, great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area.
UNK:UNK Kimchi - 5 stars. Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really don't know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.
UNK:UNK Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix. Honest, fair, and competent. I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.
UNK:UNK Perfect place for b-day dinner with the family.  Happy hour out on the patio, margaritas, sushi roll's, won ton's, pad thai.  All very tasty, great prices, good service.  Overall, I think this is one of my favorite local restaurants.  Not a big fan of chains, however I don't really feel like it's in that category.
UNK:UNK Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left
UNK:UNK I have been going here for years. I love the "Hong Kong" style pan fried crispy noodles!
UNK:UNK Totally fantastic.   I love to stop by here whenever I am in Phoenix for their pork sandwich -- which is great. I especially like the barbecue sauce that they use.   I hear on good authority that many other menu items are good, but I can't tear myself away from the the pulled pork sandwich. They also do a really tasty potato salad, sweet potato pie, and cobbler.
UNK:UNK my first time here at blue 32 was great. i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic! service was friendly and fast.
UNK:UNK Like I said with a double double you never go wrong
UNK:UNK Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around.  Very helpful personnel, friendly.  Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog.
UNK:UNK I wish there was a half star, because truly I would give it 3.5. The food is good. The ambiance is good, but the service...meh.  The reason I go...The beet salad. THE BEST in the Valley I have tasted. The pistachios and arugula with goat cheese? Diiiiiiivine. But, truth be told, if they took it off the menu, I would never come back. Still. xoxo
UNK:UNK We'll take this over Godiva any day!   The staff is always so friendly and they're always nice enough to give my kids (all 4) a sample, too.    Nothing compares to their chocolates, especially the the vanilla milk chocolate, Brown Sugar Milk Chocolate and Coconut Milk Chocolate!  Don't forget the lollipops that last FOREVER for the kids!!  Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand!
UNK:UNK I used to work here back when it was a Harkins.  It's way better now.  Comfortable, friendly, laid-back.  Kind of decorated in a golden age of hollywood style.  I dig it.
UNK:UNK Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:  42% of the time I've been hungover 30% of the time I've been drunk 22% of the time I've been sober 6%   of the time (other)  Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street.
UNK:UNK Was dragged back here for the first time in a few years. It still sucks. On a Friday night, it's like 5:1 dude to girl ratio.   Mill Cue Club is probably fine during the day if you actually want to shoot pool. But if you want to see America's future losers, stop in here after sundown.
UNK:UNK Take someone that matters here and you won't be sorry. The service is some of the best in the world, and the food is stunning. The menu changes once or twice a year, and if you can't wrangle this place on an expense account, it is THE place to impress a client. Destined for a Michelin star....
UNK:UNK I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too.
UNK:UNK We got the Gyro with fries and Spanikopita platter.  Decent non greasy gyro and the fries were lightly seasoned.  First time having spanikopita, but was pretty good.  We'll be back to try some other options.
UNK:UNK First time here, it's late night and I wanted something lite and healthy..    The place is open very late, they had lots of options and the food was perfect.  What a beautiful place inside, simple yet elegant.  Oh, the service was great too......  Go for a late night drink with a date and they'll be impressed.
UNK:UNK Great variety.  Great price!  Beats other buffets in the East Valley.
UNK:UNK Such good sandwiches! The meat is cut fresh just as your Sammy is made. Desserts to die for. Plus the family that runs this joint is cute! Yummm!
UNK:UNK Me and my husband love to shop Nordstrom Rack on the weekends! While we usually go back during the week to make our purchases when the lines aren't so long the eye candy is great on the weekends.   If you look hard enough you can find some great bargains on shoes and men's clothing. The hunt is half the fun of it.
UNK:UNK Best muffler shop in town. There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked.
UNK:UNK Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.
UNK:UNK Nothing like Capriotti's in other cities.  They don't have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here when not busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive.  Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots.  Very poor chips selection as well - only two choices.  Really? 2 chips?
UNK:UNK One of the best croissants in town, if not #1.  I base my rating solely on this and the consistently friendly service.
UNK:UNK Great dive bar and great bartenders. Jester room is a must.
UNK:UNK I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! It's a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while.
UNK:UNK Great place to have sushi and there other great menu items.   I go here at least once a month.   A litte pricey but the qualify and preparation of the food more than offsets the price.    Great place to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere.    The waite staff is very good.      Highly recommend you try RA.     I believe you will enjoy the experience.
UNK:UNK I was very happy with the food and service. The service was wonderful and quick too.
UNK:UNK Last week was my third visit to NOCA.  Since it was a Thursday, I had the wagyu pastrami sliders.  They were very good.  Thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread.  House made chips were great on the side.  Good service.  Top-quality restaurant all around.
UNK:UNK I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!
UNK:UNK This location has closed.  Went by today and found an empty restaurant.
UNK:UNK Just left. I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.  The Biagga was fantastic. Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.  Owner and staff were very friendly.   I will be back again.
UNK:UNK If I were ever to be executed, I'd want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal. With two red wine gravy.  It's *that* good.
UNK:UNK Well, this is where I got my iPad, and I am hooked of all Apple products.  Yes, they are expensive, but they are so cool.  I am amazed to see little kids playing with the iPads and computers, I am sure they are a lot more tech savvy than me.
UNK:UNK I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Valley and this is the one that I aways go back to. Their roasted duck is consistently good. Get the Ped gang daeng (801).
UNK:UNK Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!
UNK:UNK I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.  Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries.
UNK:UNK The pharmacist at this CVS really cares about her customers. Always surprised that she remembers me. Their new Minute Clinic is a bonus. I believe it is the future as more and more of us move away from company supported health care.
UNK:UNK Very nice place with a great concept in Tempe, AZ.  All I want to know is.......Where are the duck fat fries?
UNK:UNK Outdoor shopping at its best... probably not the best if its hot outside- but great outdoor dining and misters... :-)
UNK:UNK This is a lake.    It has water in it.  It's not very clean water.    The lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water.  That sucks.    I think it's semi-retarded to review a lake.
UNK:UNK Cute, cozy, pleasant and very friendly service. That is really all I have to say about them. The food was oh so delicious! Little bite sized tacos. Service was fast and just perfect! They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards. Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant.
UNK:UNK My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh. There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.
UNK:UNK Good steakhouse.  My steak was great and the sauces and salts you add on made it mire interesting than a usual steakhouse.  Almost all members of the party were satisfied and happy.
UNK:UNK This place is great. The first time I went in I didn't have change for the parking meter and they easily helped me out. Adrian cut my hair and did a great job. Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome.
UNK:UNK Thank you fellow yelper's for this recommendation! Probably the best chinese food in the west valley!
UNK:UNK I always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work. The staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great.  The sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great. You can choose between a variety of different munchies.   Over all I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key, bar atmosphere.
UNK:UNK This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in). Each and every time its been great! Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!! Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget. Highly recommended!
UNK:UNK despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.  i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go.
UNK:UNK My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.
UNK:UNK I love this place! The owner is always there and you can tell he takes great pride in what he does. Great food and great customer service!
UNK:UNK The best fried calamari in Surprise! Delish pizza! Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!
UNK:UNK Efficient friendly service and good fresh-squeezed juice. I rarely eat breakfast food but I enjoyed their New Mexico skillet.
UNK:UNK I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive...
UNK:UNK Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of "soggy crust" comments etc...
UNK:UNK At least one a week. Can't go wrong.   My family's favorite chips & hot sauce anywhere.  Wife loves the veggie burro.
UNK:UNK Alot of the items is presented neat and fresh. I like how they have fresh spinach and beef cube. Didn't care for the sushi or the mongolian BBQ though. But for $7.95 weekday lunch buffet I think the value, variety and quality is there.
UNK:UNK Best pizza in AZ, hands down.
UNK:UNK The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's.
UNK:UNK I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.  I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!
UNK:UNK I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.
UNK:UNK They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!
UNK:UNK Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks.
UNK:UNK Great selection, and great prices! Get a customer card and rack up points... at the end of the year, they send you a coupon to use on your next visit.  I spent $50 last year and got a $5 off coupon.  Staff is knowledgeable and are always available if you need help. They have a self-production line of products that are great and cost much less.  Go check it out!
UNK:UNK Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.
UNK:UNK Delish!!!!!! x 100!!  Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!
UNK:UNK I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time.   I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too.   I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!
UNK:UNK Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm
UNK:UNK As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.
UNK:UNK This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. I've said it before and I'll say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!
UNK:UNK Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.
UNK:UNK I went there for happy hour.  The chips and salsa were good.  I was a little disappointed in the service.  We had to ask for everything.  I sat there with an empty glass for quite some time.  The bartender could have been having an off night so I will give them a try again.
UNK:UNK Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
UNK:UNK Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You can't go wrong here.
UNK:UNK A must when you visit the Heard.   The staff is very professional.     James, Lora and Allison are excellent.     The shop is first class.   Great place for a collector.      Some of the finest Native American art available.          Highly recommend a visit.       You will be amazed.
UNK:UNK Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.
UNK:UNK Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!
UNK:UNK The best street taco's i've had.  As authentic and cheap as it gets...  If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty.  Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your "street tacos" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL.
UNK:UNK Very good food.  Our service was great--thank you, Heather.  She guided us to some good wines and food recommendations.  We'll be back
UNK:UNK Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!
UNK:UNK Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location.  The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my scale.  Didn't need sauce, but the sauce (sweet) was good.  The Ranch beans are a tad spicy but still good.  The slaw needs a little help.  I will definitely go back and sample the rest of the menu.
UNK:UNK I love Jimmy Johns!
UNK:UNK They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)
UNK:UNK Very tasty.  Had the pork which it typically dry but here it was really good.  The only thing is that I got bored with the flavor.  Quality of ingredients are very high.
UNK:UNK Excellent! I love this place!
UNK:UNK ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow.
UNK:UNK Love it. Wish it was in my neighborhood.
UNK:UNK This place has amazing frozen yogurt! I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries! It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since it's yogurt and not ice cream, it's a little bit healthier.
UNK:UNK Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so "mixed"... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is "lively".  So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!
UNK:UNK All I can say is DELICIOUS!!!  Service was great, food was great ,and the restaurant looks beautiful.
UNK:UNK best in the valley
UNK:UNK Sliders, cheese firies, burgers and dogs are great!  Makes us feel like we are back in Chicago without all the snow!
UNK:UNK So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). "I get a 100% tips!" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!
UNK:UNK When you walk in, it's dark and relaxing. The atmosphere is nice, quiet, with alot of dark wood highliting the place. The food is good, but be careful because the price can add up quickly. This will always be a restaurant I go to, with burgers and steaks and spinach dip. The best way to think of this place, is a lower grade of Houstons. It's almost there, but not quite.
UNK:UNK Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?
UNK:UNK My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance. We got lucky. The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked. My wife's fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach. We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler.
UNK:UNK Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!
UNK:UNK Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!
UNK:UNK UPDATE: This location is closed. Boo!
UNK:UNK Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.
UNK:UNK A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer. Try the buffet you will not be disappointed. Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.
UNK:UNK I really love this place.  The girls that work there crack me up and they can get you in and out quicker than anywhere else in the Marketplace.  Their prices are decent and their food is great.  The orange chicken is some of my favorite.  This place is very much like Panda Express but thankfully doesn't have that terrible Panda flavor (eww, panda flavor).  Bri sums up this place pretty well.
UNK:UNK What can I say, this place is an Albertsons...   Definitely not high-end like Whole Foods, but not bottom of the barrel either. It is always clean, bright, and organized. The selection is vast, and since I've seen things behind the scenes, I know they work hard to keep only fresh and undamaged food on the shelves.    disclosure: I used to work here
UNK:UNK Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there. The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.
UNK:UNK I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back.
UNK:UNK The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
UNK:UNK i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors
UNK:UNK I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious. 50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons Good morning America
UNK:UNK I've only been once to the Thai Hut, and it was after the Museum visit, as it's right across the street. Combine two cranky parents and two tired kids and it could have been an unpleasant dinner. But Thai Hut servers were very accomodating, the food was delicious and they were friendly about my kids checking out the fish and stuff... I'd go back again, for sure.
UNK:UNK Great service got there when they opened and hardly anyone was there. Our server mike was really nice. Tried the margarita chicken and  I loved it. Tequila lime sauce was to die for. And the quesadillia was huuuuuge! Its a little pricey but hello your in scottsdale!
UNK:UNK NO!  The only good dim sum in town, however, yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent.
UNK:UNK So I finally got a chance to go here for the first time, and YUMMY is the word to describe this joint. My advice get the challah French toast.   My Wife got an omelet it was really delicious too. I need to come back and try the Amanda Burrito.
UNK:UNK Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here.
UNK:UNK Very nice views of Phoenix.   Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view
UNK:UNK Great stop for a fast breakfast - the hubs had the puffed pancake with fruit on top (I LOVED how much fruit they loaded on it - and I got to eat it all because hubs doesn't like fruit so much). I got the oatmeal and a pastry - so good! The price was reasonable and I loved that it was all fresh and the flea market vibe the decor and seating offered. Free wi-fi is a bonus too!
UNK:UNK WOW! Carmel sundae was amazing!
UNK:UNK This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location. From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I can't explain how much of a help Joe has been. Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there. If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!
UNK:UNK I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy.
UNK:UNK Don't miss the carne asada! I love the carne asada mini quesadillas.
UNK:UNK standard Target.
UNK:UNK Food is good. Coffee is too week and tastes like a lot of water added to it. They charge you if they add a shot to make it taste like regular coffee.
UNK:UNK I really wanted to like this place. I'm Greek and my family cooks a lot of Greek food.  Their tzatziki sauce was runny and not flavorful. Everything was just real commercialized, nothing tasted right or even close to homemade.
UNK:UNK Very bad food!
UNK:UNK The pizza's very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken.
UNK:UNK Love the DJ here! Good music & vibe. The servers are excellent! I love the decor and the lighting of the restaurant. However, food was... presentable but taste wise nothing special.  Love their twist with cucumber water instead of lemon water! Two thumbs up for this!
UNK:UNK This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious. The only complaint I have is that I went twice and I unfortunately got hair and a fingernail clipping in my soup in two different times I went.
UNK:UNK Not impressed. I'd rather have a Big Mac and fries at McDonald's. Can't understand why some rave about it.
UNK:UNK I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it " that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back".
UNK:UNK Have you ever been to Postino for lunch?  I think of it as an after work spot, but the lunch is really good.  It's peaceful and pretty at Postino at lunchtime, the bruschetta is just as tasty during the day as it is in the evening, and the panini are good, too.
UNK:UNK i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.
UNK:UNK Love Sweet Tomatoes!  My favorite is their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad!  Although it can be expensive it is a great alternative for fast food!
UNK:UNK After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.  The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best.
UNK:UNK yum yum yum. I love Oregano's Pizza! I've always loved Oregano's... but especially the last time I went. There was a long line outside and the wait for us was 30-45mins, which I thought I was going to dread...but the servers were really nice. We were able to order drinks in the waiting area and they even came by us several times to give out pizza samples.
UNK:UNK Hate coffee. But love this environment.   Best public wifi I've experienced. Staff are friendly.  They even had a 3 star meal for this picky eater. Thorough enjoyed the comfort of my study session here.
UNK:UNK I have only had their pizza once, to go. It was ok but nothing to write home about.;... would try again but will be more skepitcal....
UNK:UNK I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!  People see my nails and always ask where I go.  I highly recommend.
UNK:UNK Pretty good food.  Place is funky, weren't many people in there for a Saturday lunch (especially considering the proximity to ASU) but the service was decent and the food was good.  Very inexpensive, 2 lunches and drinks for $15.  I'll stop by again when I'm out that way.
UNK:UNK Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.
UNK:UNK Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with.
UNK:UNK This place wasn't quite up to scratch for me.   I had the foie gras sandwich.  It was pretty good, but I was still ravenous $10 later, so I top it off with a chocolate croissant ($2.75) which was also good.    Definitely a cute space with above average dishes.  But in the end there just wasn't enough bangs for my bucks.
UNK:UNK Surprisingly good food and reasonably priced
UNK:UNK I second Sarah's review. Try the 49er flapjacks and Ron's Special Southwest Eggs (they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes). Don't forget to hit the ATM -- there's a Wells Fargo at 68th and Camelback.
UNK:UNK Delicious sandwiches!! its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more. My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasn't the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there. The regular ham with added bacon is the best!!
UNK:UNK I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing. Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal. I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships, but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day. Thanks!
UNK:UNK Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.
UNK:UNK Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!!  Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour.  Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!
UNK:UNK had a great time here the other day!  the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful.  i can't wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes!
UNK:UNK Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.
UNK:UNK If they werent located around the corner, I would never use this store.  I have taken back produce MULTIPLE times due to expiration so watch the dates when buying!!
UNK:UNK I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism. He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts. It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does. Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.
UNK:UNK Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...
UNK:UNK Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it.
UNK:UNK Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale....
UNK:UNK Just don't.
UNK:UNK Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes!  Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and it's good.  We had enough left over for next day's lunch.   The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :)  Going back for another romantic dinner soon.
UNK:UNK Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasn't excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.
UNK:UNK Pricey!!  Not my fave place to shop for vintage wares but decent to peak through.
UNK:UNK Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.
UNK:UNK The scenery was amazing!! Wooooooooo!! - Well thats my biggest impression of this place. If you're looking for a great place to golf, i suggest you swing by this place. They give you 5 stars customer service and making sure that you're having the best time of your life.
UNK:UNK AAAAMAZING. They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs. They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!
UNK:UNK My husband and one year old son dined here on a Saturday night. Service was great, food was delicious, and the BYOB was much appreciated! Staff was very accomodating with our baby. :)
UNK:UNK Fantastic atmosphere. Very Very friendly staff. Food presentation was spot on.  We had drinks and a Brick Oven Flatbread (cheese) and it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try a full entree. They had a Salmon dish on the menu I am going to try when I return. I was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering.
UNK:UNK ...for selling broccoli at a good price I gave them a chance. ...for selling celery that was already rotting I won't do so again.
UNK:UNK Friendly service but food was just ok. Maybe an off night.
UNK:UNK Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street!  After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are.  Try it, you'll like it!
UNK:UNK I love this place. Its cute its cheapish and has really good pizza and subs its also got a nice patio. Phoenix should have more places like this
UNK:UNK Excellent Excellent Excellent...  My wife and I try to eat here at least 3 -4 times a month.  Owners are very nice to chat with.  We planned a trip to Thailand this fall, and the owners help tell us where to go and what to see.
UNK:UNK I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.
UNK:UNK For some reason or another this macy's has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstrom's selection tends to be for an older crowd.
UNK:UNK My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!
UNK:UNK I'm sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago!
UNK:UNK Decent IPA, I prefer Four Peaks.  Slow service.  Food is overpriced.
UNK:UNK Good food, good service!  We go here a lot!
UNK:UNK I LOVE IKEA  I really don't understand how or why some people just hate this place, but for me it's the only nice way to interiorly design on the cheap.
UNK:UNK I love this place: look for the specials and the different events they always have going on. It's a great spot in the Valley.
UNK:UNK yummy..  you will love this place.  I love to sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy!   the sangria is amazing..  and lettuce wraps soooo great!!  give it a try!
UNK:UNK It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :)
UNK:UNK They say its bar food done right - I'd have to say I agree.  Got the burger and wings - both very solid.  Love the beer choices.  The prices are very reasonable for specialty beer and good bar food.  All in all, I am definitely going back regularly!
UNK:UNK There is a huge menu for this restaurant.  Only tried sushi and noodle soup combo dinner so far.  Lots of options on noodle soup dishes.  Each noodle soup has a different soup base.  The combo dish adds another small side dish option.  Lots of food for your money.  Sushi is decent and reasonable price.  Great Japanese family-style restaurant.
UNK:UNK I love their boneless wings! They also have a good burger, but I wouldnt recommend their chimichanga. Good beer and good service.
UNK:UNK I have been going to Tish's studio for years now! When it comes to choosing a studio to practice at, the environment and the instructors are crucially important. Hegel Yoga provides an incredible atmosphere to practice yoga, and the variety of classes available leaves little to be desired!  Great energy, great instructors, great studio.
UNK:UNK Good food, clean, with a friendly helpful staff.  Price seems a little high for the caliber of food.  Would give it 3.5 stars.
UNK:UNK Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.
UNK:UNK Love this lake. Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time. Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom. Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :)
UNK:UNK All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection.
UNK:UNK Recommended by the hotel I was staying at, this place rocks! Open seating and fantastic food... perfect set up! I had the Hot Chick, which was a perfect grilled chicken sandwich with arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta bread. Topped that off with their sweet potato fries and you will be in heaven!
UNK:UNK Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience.
UNK:UNK 2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad.  Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes. Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....it's outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OK'd this place.
UNK:UNK Love this place! Amazing Happy Hour Specials!!
UNK:UNK Nice people, great food.  A really nice white linen place.  Loved the chicken karachi, naan, samosas, chicken pakora.  Wife had a lovely red, I had a nice premium margarita.
UNK:UNK Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
UNK:UNK Guacamole was best I've had!
UNK:UNK Love Bakers. I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them. They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.
UNK:UNK Excellent.
UNK:UNK Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!
UNK:UNK Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The sauce is amazing. Every time I'm in town I get the sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce.  There's nothing else to say, really. Go here for good pizza.
UNK:UNK Great Pizza. Great Service.  We've been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball.
UNK:UNK DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!! Best whopper EVER. Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun. It's THICK.  55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents! DEAL!!!  Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)
UNK:UNK this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly.
UNK:UNK It's cute. It's homey. However...  You close at 6pm on a Wednesday night  + You were going to charge me 50 cents to process my debit card = I left with one drink and won't be back    Too bad too since my best friend lives around the corner. We would have lived here ...
UNK:UNK I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.
UNK:UNK Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.
UNK:UNK Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
UNK:UNK I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them. Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here.
UNK:UNK Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
UNK:UNK If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.
UNK:UNK Well...I wouldn't get the dragon lady roll again but the shumai were good, and the rainbow roll was good.  Too many mayo/cream cheese rolls on that menu. Not even busy on a Sunday night with the BCS game in town.  Nice atmosphere.
UNK:UNK Not really memorable but, good dependable Chinese food. I like the space too.
UNK:UNK Poor service-small portions-pricey
UNK:UNK Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food, large portions and reasonable price. The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice. Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken. Lunch or dinner, Wallys receives 5 stars from me.
UNK:UNK This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange. Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ....
UNK:UNK Each time I eat here...I always look at the menu and end up having the same thing - the ceasar salad with salmon. Nothing else really interests me on the menu. The service is good - no complaints there. But its nothing special. But I will tel you this - there is nothing like a cold beer on a hot day!
UNK:UNK This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.
UNK:UNK Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!
UNK:UNK Their happy hour is crazy cheap!!!  The scene though is like a poor mans Rehab/Wet Republic, but I'm not mad! It gets really crackin there especially on the weekends (suffice to say, I was only there for a weekend hahaha). This is definitely a spot to checkout while in Scottsdale!
UNK:UNK This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu.
UNK:UNK Yes, I can agree it is not perfect, but at least they are trying to do something different.  I didn't eat there and since I was a designated driver I only had soda.  I really enjoyed the stand up.  It is a great place to see some local performers start their career.
UNK:UNK Awesome burger and fries.
UNK:UNK My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
UNK:UNK I had heard many great things about Penzey's, but it wasn't until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!
UNK:UNK Love it! The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)  Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.  I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.
UNK:UNK It was a very lovely place. I had read the reviews before arriving and had read that the place looked dated, but it looked very nice to me. I've been to several hilton family hotels since my hubby is a diamond member and this is one of the better places we've been to.  The only thing that was sorta a deal breaker was that it wasn't near downtown.
UNK:UNK One of my fave restaurants! The unlimited salad is a winner. It's delicious! They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves!   For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals.
UNK:UNK Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants.
UNK:UNK this was my first visit to a Sizzler and I thought it was pretty good. The shrimp dinner I ordered was not that great but the salad and dessert bar made up for that. The place is no Golden Corral by any means but what they got is pretty good , you will leave with a full belly . the service was good and I was able to make a strawberry shortcake from the dessert bar. So I will say YAY I am a fan!
UNK:UNK Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town.   Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!
UNK:UNK this is perhaps the best italian food in Az. We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients. Best food, which is all homemade best service. This place never disappoints us. We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had.
UNK:UNK I had the chicken teriyaki bowl (with extra veggies and easy on the brown rice) and it was a nice lunch.  Nice alternative to fast food, although those sauces don't exactly make it healthy.
UNK:UNK I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.  I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!
UNK:UNK OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is "continentally" good
UNK:UNK Fast.  Friendly.  Cheap.  If you get the ultimate package you get a free basic car wash in a week. Just keep the receipt.
UNK:UNK We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We weren't as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizza's and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars.
UNK:UNK Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.  Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good! It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly. A gem!!!
UNK:UNK Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food.   To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!
UNK:UNK I am from Chicago - and the italian beef here really is perfection.  Add to that the friendliest people ever and the amazing hotziki with fries- and they've got me forever.  Their falafel wrap is insanely good and the patty melt is to die for.  I could eat here every day - and I practically do!
UNK:UNK Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back.
UNK:UNK Stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I ordered the Marzen barbecue chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The sauce on the sandwich was good but the chicken breast was pretty tasteless.  The garlic fries were a winner!  Service at the bar was fast and friendly.  It was nice to have a TV to watch as I ate lunch.
UNK:UNK marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it.
UNK:UNK My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side.
UNK:UNK Even though this is my home gym where I train for my shows...I really starting to not like the people here no more! The GM was very cool with me and since he got transfer to a new LA Fitness nothing isnt the same no more! Everyone here is a meat head witch I dislike!
UNK:UNK Love my Chick-fil-a!  Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur.  Amazed and they are always super friendly!  They always get the order right!!!  ++++
UNK:UNK Excellent
UNK:UNK Seriously, if you're looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear, look no further.
UNK:UNK Of course it gets hot in the summer. You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'.   Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.
UNK:UNK Outstanding customer service!!! Great camping firewood bags!!! HUGE bags of high quality, long burning wood for $10!! Cannot be beat!!!  Cash, check or use the ATM they have in the office ($2 fee).  http://www.bbfw.com/
UNK:UNK I've had Five Guys before while in Pennsylvania and thought it was good. Not any better or worse then In-Out or Fatburger. Tried this location the other night though and was disappointed. Lettuce was slimey,buns soggy and the doneness of the patties, inconsistent.  I'm not completely writing them off but will be in no huge rush to return.
UNK:UNK I have stayed at the Firesky on a few different occasions.  I love the place.  Granted, there are nicer, more luxurious places to stay in the area, but for the price, you can't beat it.  The pool area and bar are fantastic, the staff is super friendly (which seems to be the case all over AZ), and the lobby is very cool with its ostrich skin couches.
UNK:UNK Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else.
UNK:UNK Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My "Artichoke dip" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My 'eggless eggrolss" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area.
UNK:UNK This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store. The produce is plentiful and fresh, they have Boars Head at the deli, and they have organic options. The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs. It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices.
UNK:UNK This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.  *Price = on the high-end  *Pad Thai = pretty good volume *Green Curry = very good. *Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11
UNK:UNK Fun place for happy hour. Good prices, good food and great staff.
UNK:UNK I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!
UNK:UNK I love this theater!! it's 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly. I believe that the have child care if you have any. also lot's of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ Norterra.
UNK:UNK Love Oregano's :)   The 45 minute wait for deep dish pizza does not bother me much because I know I am going to get it just the way I like it. Lots of pepperoni and easy sauce. The BBQ wings are so good. They are crispy, hot, and bathed in sauce. Service at Oregano's has never failed me. In Tucson, AZ and in Phoenix, AZ service is great :)
UNK:UNK This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.
UNK:UNK This was my first time here. It was a nice experience.. And I found that I really like Indian food ! Good stuff !
UNK:UNK The salmon was great. They overcooked my husbands steak, which was just a so-so steak. City hall is much preferred!
UNK:UNK Best in south chandler.  Glad they are out here
UNK:UNK Maybe I expected too much. The silverware was plastic. The plates were plastic. I felt like I was at a cookout.
UNK:UNK Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY. Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day). I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)
UNK:UNK I love that there is a locals place right within walking distance of my apartment.  I've been drinking there for a couple weeks now and I love the good beer and cheap prices.  I just ate there for the first time last night and the chicken sandwich and curly fries are delicious.  The service is reasonable, the atmosphere is friendly, and the patio makes for a great hang out.
UNK:UNK The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
UNK:UNK Good food, but I don't care for the SUPER FAST waitstaff. Fast is one thing, but walking away while I am still trying to order is RUDE.
UNK:UNK If you love Korean food, you will not be disappointed! The hot tofu soups are so good and served piping hot with your choice of spiciness. Their galbi ribs and bulgogi are authentic and as good as it gets. My son loves their pork katsu, which is served with rice, salad, and potato salad; and the servings are huge!  We are regulars and bring visiting family and friends frequently. Great place!
UNK:UNK best place in scottsdale to watch a game. Great food (greasy, but what bar food isn't?), great drink specials, and an even better atmosphere. The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I will definitely return in the future.
UNK:UNK I'm addicted! Everyone there is so freakin nice. And Maui dogs are delicious.
UNK:UNK I am so glad I found this nursery! Not only is it a beautiful place but the employees are unbelievable, so helpful and knowledgeable.   Needed to get my garden ready for planting and they helped with everything. The plants they have look great, not all wilted like some other places.   Think this has become one of my weekend stops.
UNK:UNK Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff, but I've *always* been disappointed in the grub at 5&Diner... The service was STELLAR and I really do like the ability to dine Al-Fresco at 3am, but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco??? ughghg.
UNK:UNK Service was s l o w. Toook a l o n g time for someone to greet us and when they did only dropped off menus. Wait. Wait. We ordered beverages and food at same time. Things showed up one by one...  I ordered the Spicy Basil which was very flavorful and I thought was the best tasting of the 3 entrees.
UNK:UNK My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...
UNK:UNK I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.
UNK:UNK Perfect for a nightcap. Dim, moody lighting and totally intimate. Drinks are pretty pricy and didn't eat any food, but the service was great! I loved the 'feel' of the place so much I'd go back sometime.
UNK:UNK realized I rank this a 3, what am I insane??
UNK:UNK Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate.
UNK:UNK Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!
UNK:UNK Good food, tiny portions, pricey for the amount you get.
UNK:UNK Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
UNK:UNK I don't see what the big deal is. When I went the soda machine was broken, and the food was bland. Didn't really think the fries were anything to care about. Very sub-par, and more over, just because they give you all you can eat, free peanuts, doesn't mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog. Not worth the money, not worth the trip in my opinion. Wouldn't return, wouldn't recommend.
UNK:UNK First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back.   I hope it is............
UNK:UNK The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.
UNK:UNK This store is 2 miles from my house so I am there all the time. I find their customer service has been consistently good. Even on Black Friday at 7am the sales help has been very pleasant and very helpful.
UNK:UNK decently priced Korean food. they offer more soups and korean style casseroles - no dolsot bibimbap, BUT their kalbi tang is reallllly good! Huge bowl, lots of kalbi, yum yum yum!  they're also open a lot later than many other restaurants, always a plus!
UNK:UNK I enjoy their Rama Chicken. Their peanut sauce is great. However, their service is slow. It is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long. If they improved their service my rating  would be 5 stars.
UNK:UNK $5 pitchers of Four Peaks brews? That's an awesome happy hour!  Bruschetta is amazing... $13 is a bit much for it, but still super tasty!  Great environment. Happy staff. Killer design and music.  Great location.  Love it!
UNK:UNK I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and "real" plastic plates! Lol.
UNK:UNK Wooot for "grown up slushies!"  This place is a staple of my Vegas adventures and was just as fun in AZ.  We hit Happy Hour for cheap drinks & apps after an expensive Octoberfest. Lord please forgive me for the extra shots of everclear on top...$1 floaters...they should be ashamed of themselves...sinful...I LOVEDDD it!
UNK:UNK Over the top cheesesteaks. Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world. Amazing food and friendly service. Best ever.
UNK:UNK I've only ever had the carne asada quesadilla and churros, but they are damn good.
UNK:UNK My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left.   The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.  Go to Sens instead.
UNK:UNK Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The "Bacado". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service. Delicious.
UNK:UNK Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.
UNK:UNK Best pizza place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UNK:UNK Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.
UNK:UNK I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....
UNK:UNK A good place for bugers and fries.
UNK:UNK If you love BBQ, this place is for you.    Nostalgic feel with a farm tactor sitting in the dining room.  Good selection of sides and the rootbeer is home made.    Like Joe's Farm Grill, this place can draw a crowd and you'll be in for a long wait for service but timing is everything.  Can be a bit pricey is you load up but the quality of the food is top notch!  I'll definately be back.
UNK:UNK Not so good anymore. Plus the "aura" of the place has become a little snotty.
UNK:UNK Place is avg.  Sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad. Service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on, and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order.   I would try to find another place.
UNK:UNK We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctor's office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.
UNK:UNK Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.
UNK:UNK Best damn Brownies on the planet (or close to it)! Words cannot explain how good they are. The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office! Way too much temptation.
UNK:UNK Made the mistake of coming here on opening day.  Not a good idea for someone with anxiety issues.  They had a bunch of really good deals, but I fear it is probably going to be the same as going to Walmart.  And I HATE going to walmart.
UNK:UNK Great service !!! Food was good, not spectacular, but very good. They had some crative rolls and a few really good appetizers.  Cool little spot that kinda hides in a non descript spot , I will certainly be back if I get a chance before leaving town
UNK:UNK This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items.   You MUST get the bruchetta plate.
UNK:UNK Air Jordan! need I say more?
UNK:UNK This was a nice casino experience.  It wasn't as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.  Admittedly, I chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino, but ah well.  I still had a great time.  I don't really gamble, so I only came out $10 ahead, but it was still fun.
UNK:UNK Very nice place and delicious food!
UNK:UNK So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!
UNK:UNK This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isn't chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  I've had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce.
UNK:UNK Stop here every time I'm in town!
UNK:UNK This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line, which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!
UNK:UNK I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner
UNK:UNK Well I liked this place it smokes it's main rival Hooters. The food is much better more  screen TV's and the girls are much better looking. What else can you say.
UNK:UNK We have been using Delia's Cleaners now for nearly three years and for the most part found the experience to be very good.    Yes, like most cleaners they goof from time to time (like sometimes killing the button-downs on my dress shirts).  But, here's the difference -- they'll fix them for no charge.  Yep.  Just ask, the staff is very helpful!
UNK:UNK The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If you've ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!
UNK:UNK How to Have a Good Time at Cowboy Ciao:  1) Order the Stetson chopped salad.   2) Finish it.  3) Order the Peanut Butter Brownie Upside Downy.  (Note: DO NOT question whether you're full or not. It doesn't matter).  4) Finish it.
UNK:UNK I love the cornbread and butter but the rest can do without. The plates are so huge and super sloppy. The lettuce wraps are no good!  I did like our waitress but the bar tender with blonde hair was supper bitchy to the other staff it was annoying.
UNK:UNK I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.    If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go.   Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk).
UNK:UNK I had great service and the Red Curry Chicken was wonderful. I only wish the dish wad a little warmer serving temperature. The Thia iced tea was fantastic.
UNK:UNK We were taken here by our host in Phoenix.  It's one of the prettiest Mexican restaurants I've been in, with a courtyard surrounding a duck pond (there is a sign requesting you not feed the ducks tortilla chips!).  The margaritas were great and my chicken was excellent, as were my partner's tequila shrimp.  Would definitely go back there if I were to visit Phoenix again.
UNK:UNK I'm giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason:  The veggie sandwich!   There's normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds I'd pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)
UNK:UNK Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.   It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.   They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :(
UNK:UNK We went there for a dinner today, very nice place, a little noisy for my baby thougt ;) I had the italian wedding soup, it was very good but a little spicy. I also have a glass of wine, prosecco with passion fruit, very good... My husband had a tagliatelle w/braised short ribs, which he said was delicious.  The service was very good as well. The patio looks great for when the weather wams up.
UNK:UNK basically, i'm only reviewing this store because i really do not care for the employees here. there are a few nice ones, but overall, they are either cranky, stressed out, or missing.  the redeeming points? a nice selection of crafting products. but then again, you can always just go to a DIFFERENT location. i'd opt for that.
UNK:UNK I didn't stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. It's a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here.
UNK:UNK The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didn't annoy me. I'd go back
UNK:UNK This place isn't the best looking, but it's pretty tasty! I find myself craving the strange mix of foods they serve here. I order the Emerald chicken burrito and the Jerk Chicken quesadillas. The best part is if you've never been there before, they give you tons of samples and tell you all about the foods you can order.  I wish they had more locations :)
UNK:UNK Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.
UNK:UNK I'm not a big drinker, but this place is pretty sweet if you are. Huge selection at excellent prices.
UNK:UNK Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
UNK:UNK Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.   I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.
UNK:UNK Walgreen's has the best nuts. However, they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper, 2-for on the halves and pieces. And they upped the price (again) on the whole cashews.  I will be shopping elsewhere.
UNK:UNK Better like it hot...these folks do not know the meaning of the word "mild"! Plentiful, tasty Mexican fare at a good price...always a good bet.
UNK:UNK Best toasted subs... EVER. I order the White Widdow and pretty much stick to that. It's awesome. The cheesy garlic bread... delish! Try it with pepper jack =) This place is a regular for us when we want a good sandwich. Hey... even my mom loves this place.
UNK:UNK I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
UNK:UNK I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
UNK:UNK I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!! Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!!
UNK:UNK What can I say, this place has it all. Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from.  I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.  Simply delicious.
UNK:UNK Found this today while cruising down 7th on my way to Roosevelt Row for some belated Christmas shopping. Very cute interior. I got the Torta, which was huge and extremely tasty with moist, seasoned asada, guac, veggies, and jalapenos on a soft buttery bread. Mmm!
UNK:UNK Just the basics.  Nothing fancy here but you can get a pedicure with hot stone massage for $18!
UNK:UNK I had my brows done one month ago.  Heather did an amazing job!  I went back after 2 weeks for a "no charge" touch up.  I haven't worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.  I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her.  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!
UNK:UNK We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on.
UNK:UNK Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy.
UNK:UNK my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,
UNK:UNK We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience.
UNK:UNK I have never actually been to a pawn shop for any reason. I can't honestly even tell you what they are used for. I have never seen Pawn Stars. I don't watch television.   I really enjoy this signage. On an almost daily basis. Savy, that is all it is. Love of a little morning chuckle.
UNK:UNK Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back.
UNK:UNK This little place is great, the service, the tacos, the guac, and the prices!
UNK:UNK Ordered a large cheese pizza. The crust was ok, not very flavorful. The pie had a pool of grease covering it. This pizza had a bland sauce and very little of it. It just seemed that minimal effort went into the pizza. This pizza is not worth a second visit.
UNK:UNK We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao.
UNK:UNK Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too!   Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!
UNK:UNK Great place, great food, great staff. I just had a chicken salad but my husband had the Jambalaya, he said it was the best he had ever had.Had the bread pouding for dessert..fantastic! We wil certainly return.
UNK:UNK I love Defalco's.  I hate Defalco's.  The food is always fresh and I'm never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  It's  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know I'm not in a rush to be somewhere.
UNK:UNK This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.
UNK:UNK very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
UNK:UNK Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called 'hardy' portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.
UNK:UNK dragged my husband here because the menu online lists a particular kind of spring roll that i love. and when we show up, the menu was TOTALLY different.   this place is geared toward your typical Arizona-white crowd. it's pretty watered down Viet food, and was sorely disappointing. and expensive. boo. go across the street to Mekong if you prefer better tasting, more authentic Viet food.
UNK:UNK Love this place!  Been going to this location for years.  The food is always great and the price isn't too bad either.  The only thing I would say is a con is the service.  You never know what kind of mood the server will be in or if they will be attentive or not.  This place is delicious if you're looking for steak, or seafood, burgers, etc.
UNK:UNK A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it.  The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good.  The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review.  Otherwise, the food is good not great.
UNK:UNK Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch. Even have almond milk!  Excellent choices. Super nice people. Comfortable space. Let's help support these independent shops who exude caring, quality and individuality to thrive in our community!
UNK:UNK Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!
UNK:UNK Great location and within walking distance to Scottsdale and old Scottsdale.  Really well maintained and bed / pillow were the most comfy ever!  We typically stayed at another resort but this was a great substitute. They allow pets in many rooms so request a non-pet room if you wish.
UNK:UNK New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!
UNK:UNK Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.
UNK:UNK I'll admit I almost fell outta my chair after hitting a triple-double on the Malibu. Quite generous pours plus delish menu. Can't wait to go back and try out the dance floor!!! Did I mention the Disco Ball?? Yeah, baby!
UNK:UNK Absolutely fabulous espresso place! The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee! I didn't have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly! I'll be here every time I visit Chandler!
UNK:UNK Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!
UNK:UNK Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.
UNK:UNK Successfully blending the idea of bar food and airline food into one very disappointing meal. A poor choice for breakfast due to mealy/watery eggs, cold potatoes and bland salsa. Even the grapefruit juice lacked flavor.
UNK:UNK Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!! The Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!
UNK:UNK Don't dog Old Navy.   Despite a sub par and semi-annoying marketing campaign, clothes here are aight with me.   And where else can you get a perfectly good pair of cargos and boardshorts for less than thrity bucks a pop? I'm no fashion snob, but I like to think I can generally distinguish "awful" from "not awful" in most cases.   For the "not awful" variety, Old Navy is dirt cheap and top notch.
UNK:UNK Contemporary atmosphere.  Good range of Italian offerings.  Attentive wait staff.  Portions generous.  Price reasonable.  Food fine.   I'd go again.
UNK:UNK Only reason for the 2 stars is for the service.  The food was not very good at all. My dinner was hardshell taco's or something that consist of hardshell taco's but when they came out the shells were soggy and you couldn't eat them.  The drink specials were good and we had a very nice server.
UNK:UNK Still love their bagels and apparently I am not the only one since they won Phoenix New Times for Best Bagel (2011).
UNK:UNK Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff.
UNK:UNK This is one of Scottsdale's new hot spots. If you like the 'Scottsdale' scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy.
UNK:UNK Pros: 1.  Excellent service.  Hell, it's damned right impeccable.   2.  Superclean and comfortable rooms. 3.  Excellent amenities and top notch spa.  Cons. 1.  J-Dubb's a little spendy on the cocktail side. 2.  KEEP THE POOL BAR OPEN LATER! MY GOD!!!  I'd like to watch the sun set with a cocktail, rather than have the sidewalk rolled up around 5.
UNK:UNK ALTERNATIVE!!  That's what this place is and in the land of BIG chains, this only could add some spice. We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event. The personnel is totally committed to their project.   If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don't enjoy (but others do - horror), this is a good alternative.
UNK:UNK Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.
UNK:UNK Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.
UNK:UNK I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!
UNK:UNK Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of family's where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding.  The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city.
UNK:UNK Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.
UNK:UNK Intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare. Good presentation and wine pairings. Outdoor area is nice, though as others have pointed out, there's basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark.
UNK:UNK About 1.6 miles roundtrip from the Maricopa Ramada.  Pretty cool little climb, but then you end up on a road heading to the summit.  Near the top, you get to go offroad for a bit to the very top.  You can see 7th St go all the way downtown.  Total time up and back was 50:12.  Pretty easy hike.  This was my third of four mountains, one Saturday in April.
UNK:UNK The Fries Need Work! I have been here several times now and the fries have been a disappointment . They are not the crispy fluffy potatoey goodness that Belgian fries are supposed to be.  Having said that, everything else from the brats to the beer to the service is worth the trip.  The outside patio is like being at a German Biergarten without all the kitch.  Check it out!
UNK:UNK I love this place, so cute and trendy, and great food! love the crepes but my fav is the BBQ pork sandwich. its so flavorful with avocado. Pastries are great too. Great place for lunch or afternoon tea.
UNK:UNK I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?
UNK:UNK Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!
UNK:UNK Loved my visit here. I was talked into the meatloaf for dinner. I have never ordered meatloaf at a restaurant, but tonight I did. The combination of meatloaf, and a bit of mashed potatoes and gravy on my fork......HEAVEN. I was sure to chew in every corner of my mouth....my taste buds were going crazy.......
UNK:UNK This place is kind of hidden and very quiet, but from the reviews it seems like they've got quite a few patrons! I thought the food was just okay... I've eaten here twice and I admit that the prices are excellent but unfortunately it's not enough to keep me coming back. Staff was pretty friendly, so I thought that was a plus.
UNK:UNK Pretty good food. Super friendly service. Very clean.  First time I have had duck at a buffet and it was pretty good, just not the crispy skin. Lot of seafood items. They kept things well stocked and didn't just dump the new stuff into the old (a health code violation) They pulled the old pan out and put the new one in.   We will definitely be back.
UNK:UNK Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.
UNK:UNK Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,
UNK:UNK Yay!! This place is fantastic. Great pastries and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back.
UNK:UNK I think this place is hyped up a little more than it should be. I've tired their bruschetta, pizzas and salads. They were decent and I have no complaints but nothing to rave about. A decent place to pop in to for lunch since they have counter service that you order at.
UNK:UNK Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?
UNK:UNK The food is solid, but not awesome.  The room is kind of ugly and occasionally not too fragrant.  If you want Vietnamese, you want it dirt cheap and you want it now, this place gets it done.  If you want a warm, memorable dining experience, this is not the place.
UNK:UNK Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up.
UNK:UNK The service was excellent and the location was great in Old Scottsdale.  For the price, I was shocked at the small portions of food, although nicely presented.  I'm not a big eater, but after we ate an over-priced dinner, appetizer portions, we had to go elsewhere to eat.
UNK:UNK I've only flown in and out of Pheonix Airport through Southwest, so i've only been in one section of this airport- but it isn't that great. THe food choices are slim and none are fab- I mean, really what airport had fab food- wait DFW does! Anyway- the Sky Harbor does have is a great view and decently clean restrooms.
UNK:UNK The food was AMAZING... The service was mediocre. The hostess ruined our entire experience.
UNK:UNK Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.
UNK:UNK I thought I disliked brownies, but these are damn good. In fact, every flavor is delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. Holla!
UNK:UNK Good works
UNK:UNK A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.
UNK:UNK Always love it!! so good and good price
UNK:UNK This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is. I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.  Try: - Mushroom Party Pizza - Roasted Corn Pizza - Baked Wings - Red Velvet Cake  Only con is the parking is kinda crazy.
UNK:UNK This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!
UNK:UNK I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!
UNK:UNK I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the "hole-in-the-wall" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling.
UNK:UNK Nice , big, clean, and lots to chose from. This place has a very nice SCUBA section, and that is hard to find in  the desert. I purchased a gift card for a friend and that is why I showed up. Lots of good stuff and a wonderful staff. I live by Dicks so that is where I usually go, but if in the neighborhood I would hit them up.
UNK:UNK Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.
UNK:UNK I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years. My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs. Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not. This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.
UNK:UNK Best seafood place I have found in the Phoenix area.  Everything from the crap dip to the crab legs and oysters is delicious. They have a wonderful fish selection as well and even their steaks are good.  Service has always been excellent every time I have gone.  Can get very busy on nights so try and go early if you can.
UNK:UNK I guess you really can't put lipstick on a pig. I will say this, it's nice inside all new building and equipment, but it's very much a westside gym. Many Raider hats and 0.0 eye candy. I would rather go to Moon Valley all the same new stuff but much better loking people. I will say this, it's good to see people in a gym that need to be there, and it also seems very gay friendly.
UNK:UNK A new breakfast option in old town Scottsdale. The decor is superb and the weekend crowd is minimal. Juevos Rancheros and the Skirt Steak & Eggs are both fabulous. Prices for breakfast are reasonable.
UNK:UNK go to the reverse happy hour where reasonably edible sushi is served at reasonable prices amidst, in the instance of our  visit, barely legal drinking aged crowd. in a mall. nuff said.
UNK:UNK this place is no where close to anything you can get in la or oc. It taste liked it came out of the bag. plain and simple
UNK:UNK So yummy! Strange combination but great place
UNK:UNK So sad closed. Oh well.
UNK:UNK What more can I say except it is over priced, greasy Mexican food! I have had better in Texas, the only thing that saved them from being a one star is their great salsa!
UNK:UNK Food was really good. You could tell it's good quality. Our service was not so good.  Workers are friendly but were having bad day on service.
UNK:UNK I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop...
UNK:UNK I contacted the owner based on his comment regarding my review and he never contacted me back.  Hmmm...
UNK:UNK I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite.   I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?
UNK:UNK Best cupcakes ever. I can't get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet. They even have a gluten free Red Velvet! Order several to take home. They will give you a zip-loc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days! I'm addicted. Not cheap, about $22 for 6 but when you taste them, who cares....
UNK:UNK Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.  The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture.  I wish I still worked closer...
UNK:UNK These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.   Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch.
UNK:UNK Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.
UNK:UNK Super cool place I've been to 3-4 times now and only drawback is the noise if you are with someone you want to have a conversation with. Service could be better, but location and above average food at decent prices cancel that out.
UNK:UNK Food was tolerable, and tasteless.  The chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard (almost stale) when eating. The entrees we ordered were bland.  The rice and beans had no flavor at all.  Maybe that is Baja style of food, but couldn't find the flavor anywhere. The service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, but I don't think we'll be going to this place again.
UNK:UNK The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit
UNK:UNK great beer selection great live music great atmosphere I used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight. there is always something to be had at rosie's.
UNK:UNK I LOVE this place. I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since I'm back for a business trip! I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. Their prices are great too! Very polite staff.
UNK:UNK Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
UNK:UNK This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix, absolutely great coffee! Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school let's out or rush hour.
UNK:UNK Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!
UNK:UNK Love Love Love it. The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce. You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy. Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals. Then they have a punch card program as well. My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.
UNK:UNK I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away.
UNK:UNK Love this place, been coming for many years and recently stopped by for their italian sub.  Still as good as ever, these guys have great quality produce and a simple but yet complex style in their sandwiches. Little details make me appreciate them, ohh yeah and they have good tea.
UNK:UNK Great fresh sandwiches!! The pastrami and caprese are absolute perfection!! The orzo pasta salad is spot on for the summer.  Definitely a must id in mesa..they need more central location for sure!
UNK:UNK Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!
UNK:UNK Standard Burger King fare served at a snail's pace.  One cook, one sandwich maker, one cashier, plus 30 people in the queue.  Please help the economy and the waiting customers by hiring some staff!
UNK:UNK Great store but lack of certain items
UNK:UNK 20% off with a Yelp check in? SCORE!   They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale. But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry! There's a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches. I snatched up two really cute vintage rings.
UNK:UNK I have been here twice so I know what's the best items for my taste. Would give another star if the Mongolian grill had more items and sauces. Trying the evening buffet tomorrow with 2 teenage son's one whose 18 and a football player. Should definitely get my moneys worth!
UNK:UNK I love their turkey and provolone cold sub! Delicious with pickles added.
UNK:UNK Really good, healthy food.  Owner is super friendly. Would definitely recommend. :)
UNK:UNK Mylissa has given my daughter and me the *best* cuts! If you can, see her. She will take great care of you!
UNK:UNK Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!
UNK:UNK Love this place. the atmosphere was rather chill and calm. We played Uno, and drank pretty darn good coffee! we had a lemon cookie, which was...JUST RIGHT!
UNK:UNK We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.  Fantastic place!  Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.  Will definitely be back again soon!
UNK:UNK The kids love panda express.  My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food. This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat.  And to be honest- I don't mind it either.
UNK:UNK Great gelato. It's actually very creamy so kinda taste more like an ice cream but still incredible. Lots of flavors probably 30+. Haven't had a bad one yet. Love the Roche, chocolate and pistachio. Just had a pizza last visit- they have a new pizza oven. Good thin crust, tasty ingredients, soggy in the middle kind of like Pomo.  Give it a try!
UNK:UNK Bad ass, just like the name.  I've heard that this facility doesn't have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  It's definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, it's a great deal.
UNK:UNK I'm a great believer and loyal customer of Carried Away.  They do carry LV, although they fly off the shelves fast! I've brought in 2 and both were gone by days end! If you'd like to be put on a "call list" when they come in, they'll do that for you! Although there are several others that are on it too.  I'm going in today to drop off two more in fact! Happy holiday!
UNK:UNK I love osso bucco, they have really good mexi-style osso bucco, so I love them.  I prefer to sit on the patio or in the bar.  But keep in mind, parking sucks if you go on a busy night.
UNK:UNK Fresh and simple!  Taste's great!  Worth the drive!  The burgers are like the ones you make at home!  I had the sweet potato fries, highly recommended.
UNK:UNK Crust is chewy.  Pizza is below-average.  Nice owner though.
UNK:UNK We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!
UNK:UNK Beer heaven!  What don't they have?  The staff has a taste for heavy body beer so if that isn't your ONLY criteria for great beer.  I would just go with your gut.  Their staff does know their stuff.
UNK:UNK Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If you're going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold. Too busy, too long of a wait, too hungry to change. Other items tasted at our table did not receive much better feedback. I can't recall what others ate. In fact, there wasn't much worth remembering.
UNK:UNK The view, services, and drinks were perfect, but the food was nah... not good.  Went there twice, first time was for drinks and view, it was wonderful, so we went again for dinner, the dish was not good.  If you want a wonderful meal for your date, try somewhere else and go there for the drinks and view.  After having a dinner there, I won't bring my guests there except for the view and drinks.
UNK:UNK Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the "junk" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)
UNK:UNK Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.  Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D
UNK:UNK Very Clean store. But I guess when you're paying about 300% more than you would anywhere else, the place can afford it. The people in the front are pretty friendly. There is a lady in the deli, she is pretty friendly/talkative. There are people who mill around the store wearing name tags, they are not friendly or polite.  I just cannot get over how expensive safeway is.
UNK:UNK Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff' said.
UNK:UNK I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER! the vibe is young clean and fresh.  the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:
UNK:UNK One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or "no Tip" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific.
UNK:UNK Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!  The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.  Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard.
UNK:UNK Very good, fresh food, nice ambiance, reasonable prices & good service.  We're from out of town & found this place with the help of Yelp!  We'd definitely come back again!  We had the Caprese Salad & the Sicily pizza.  Both very good.
UNK:UNK Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
UNK:UNK Gross, tasteless food.  Good margaritas.
UNK:UNK Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
UNK:UNK Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!
UNK:UNK I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great "down home" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also.
UNK:UNK I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever.  A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly.
UNK:UNK SawTh[sic] Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend.  Great show - laughed my ass off.  Thinking about going back for closing weekend...  :)
UNK:UNK Very relaxed atmosphere and employees are super nice. We typically go here late at night just in time to get in an order of chicken skewers(which are super yummy) and then have  few drinks. They have 2 pool tables and a shuffle board which always makes for a fun night.
UNK:UNK I've been going here for the past 9+ years and it's pretty much the basic local circle-K. Not much to say past that. I do dig the walk-in beer cooler but also wonder who in the hell buys the bags of bananas?
UNK:UNK There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm  The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors  I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...
UNK:UNK How excited can you get about a car wash joint? Well, not very! Yet, this place does a good job for $8.99. They're pretty thorough, includes vacuuming, and it looked like they sprayed some waxey stuff on my Wifey's black, Honda CRV... Looks great! They have a lovely inventory of greeting cards as well.
UNK:UNK Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids.
UNK:UNK This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley. Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water. I've seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in. Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with. For photos and a complete review of this park go to www.dogparkriot.com.
UNK:UNK I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
UNK:UNK The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)
UNK:UNK Very nice and helpful staff. One guys always asks me too many questions but I figured he was just trying to be nice. They're on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service. But when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it.
UNK:UNK Wow! Food was great! But the service was even better!!! We got there early so we didn't have to wait a long time.    Their computer system was down, so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers, they comped out lunch. So impressed with this place! And such a cool vibe!
UNK:UNK Gracie's is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didn't find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card.
UNK:UNK Update: they added a gorgeous new countertop (sans coffee wobbling mosiacs) and (ta-da!) a glass enclosed bakery display case! My friend Jefferson can now order his pastries with confidence.
UNK:UNK Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure.
UNK:UNK Way overpriced. Wide selection. Good to browse, not to buy. Check out your local mexican market.
UNK:UNK Polite friendly staff. Great, always clean place.  The gym is great and never too crowded.
UNK:UNK My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy.
UNK:UNK This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap! If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out! First time clients get a discount! I will never go anywhere else!
UNK:UNK Hole in the wall? Yes Amazing food? Definitely Clean? Questionable but I could care less  The tortillas are really as good as everyone claims. Food was prepared pretty quickly. I had two machaca tacos and the beef was really tender and flavorful. A friend from Phoenix recommended this place and we stopped by on a trip from up north. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make sure to stop by!
UNK:UNK The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!
UNK:UNK Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, it's SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for?
UNK:UNK Great experience at Citizen PH...highly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price!!
UNK:UNK Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)
UNK:UNK ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!
UNK:UNK LOVE this place.  The parking is terrible.  That's what keeps me from being a regular. Coffee and deserts are SUPERB.  Atmosphere is A+. Love the gifts.
UNK:UNK I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :)
UNK:UNK Hard to find New York pizza that tastes like New York pizza.  All the way from Morristown, NJ, this place is now the only place I order NY style pizza.
UNK:UNK Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point
UNK:UNK Nice car-wash with reasonable prices and decently friendly staff. I can tell the staff is used to dealing with the older gentleman types versus the hip and fun 30-something female SUV driving Mom types, but that's ok. The Mom-mobile was detailed just right, the wait wasn't too long, and the air freshener lasted more than 1/2 a day.   Way way better than Cobblestone Spa over on Bell Rd.
UNK:UNK Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !'
UNK:UNK I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.
UNK:UNK I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.  grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say
UNK:UNK What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.
UNK:UNK Had a fantastic massage with Liz.  She knew all the muscle structure and pressure points.  Though not the fanciest of places, it's perfect if you just need to get a massage.  If you want to be pampered and get the spa feel, this may not be your place.  For me, my back hurt from sleeping crooked and I left feeling much better.
UNK:UNK Typical anglophiles, my lady and I gravitated toward the tea garden. But that doesn't mean we didn't love photographing and learning about the myriad plants that call the desert home.  I was particularly enchanted by the century agave and giraffe trees.  Give yourself plenty of time to walk the garden's many loops. I would recommend at least four hours.
UNK:UNK These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!
UNK:UNK Seriously need a remodel, but totally worth the money due to the free 24hr shuttle in a 5 mile radius!! Nice staff. Clean. Just worn down a bit...
UNK:UNK One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened.
UNK:UNK Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great. The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.  Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it.
UNK:UNK Love their pizza and atmosphere. Their Caesar salad is really good too. They had a great deal during the summer, where we got 2 salads, 1 large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for $40.
UNK:UNK Economical discount theater!  For the price of what other theaters charge just for admission, you can get your popcorn and drink too!  Seats are a little small, but there are usually plenty of them.  It is of course not the newest releases, but I am never up to date on my movie watching anyway.  Must have cash, ATM available in the lobby area.
UNK:UNK Food used to be a lot better, service too. Not awful though.
UNK:UNK all the naysayers seem have a bone to pick, the service here is incredible and the food is better.  vegan options as well and staff that helps make sure your order has no egg or fish sauce.  if your looking for thai, this is the best place in the valley we have been to, and being vegan, we have been to too many to count
UNK:UNK This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.
UNK:UNK We enrolled our son in this program. It was EXCELLENT! Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best "new" licensed driver.  Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us.
UNK:UNK I love this place. The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.  Great vibe. Great food. Great price. You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)
UNK:UNK Awesome carne asada, veggie taco and just about everything else.  Delicious and very easy on my wallet.
UNK:UNK I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I haven't get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me.
UNK:UNK Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.
UNK:UNK We went here after the Rainbow Festival and it was such a great place! The food was great, the service was awesome and the patio is a great place to enjoy your meal! Bliss has made it to my list of places to eat downtown!
UNK:UNK Excellent food and service!
UNK:UNK GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY With a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines). Don't miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink. Oh yea the owners are OK also
UNK:UNK Love this place.  Great staff!  Friendly, fun and knowledgable.  The food is always good.
UNK:UNK Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.    The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again.
UNK:UNK I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasn't until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!
UNK:UNK I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!
UNK:UNK Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken.
UNK:UNK North Valley always has interesting articles to read and cool interviews with people like Alice Cooper and Young MC (Bust a Move!).  The magazine covers the entire north valley, which is very spread out. And you can find it in many different places, from Kierland to Anthem. It's free, but you can also get a subscription online.
UNK:UNK Yummy! Worth the wait. Yes, it is all the hype so get a drink, enjoy the scenery and munch on some fabulous pizza. Not one thing I wouldn't order. Have fun and have a slice for me!
UNK:UNK Go here if you live in AZ.  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.    I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child.  Might want to get a babysitter for this one.
UNK:UNK Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it.
UNK:UNK The problem with a place like this is the hype.  Five stars from yelpers, must be amazing!  But sorry, I've had better Eggs Benedict.  For me just too far to drive for the mediocre food and marginal service.
UNK:UNK Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.  EVER!  I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.
UNK:UNK I have been going here sense I was a kid! They have the best food that is not comparable to anything else! It is a must try restaurant!! I always leave pleased :)
UNK:UNK Love coming here to watch football. Every game is on and they have three huge screens. The service there is usually friendly, I've never had any problems but sometimes my friend thinks the ladies are a little rude. Never esteem here but the drinks are pretty strong. When I'm in Phoenix I come here for sports.
UNK:UNK Best Italian sub I've had. Very nice owners. Just be aware there's no place to sit, so you'll have to get it to go.
UNK:UNK Nice resort located in downtown Chandler. The rooms are spacious and fairly comfortable . Chill by the pool and sip on a margarita from the pool bar.
UNK:UNK I really like this Urgent Care!  Don't let their youthful looks fool you! John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring! In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I can't wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.  Great job gentlemen and staff!
UNK:UNK Very sexy place where people love to be seen. Very pretentious but I liked it! Food is just ok - I have had better!
UNK:UNK My boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never  been here together - I thought that I might chime in as well. I really enjoyed this little burger place.  It makes eating a burger seem fancy in a very modern setting.  I really LIKE the sweet potato french fries....Mmmmm!
UNK:UNK So many great accessories and cute clothes! I got my accessories for my Wedding here, and they were perfect. Everything from clutches to earrings, from cute tops to watches, they have everything color coordinated!
UNK:UNK Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.
UNK:UNK This is a club -- not a lounge, or supper club.  I was drugged and dumped here by friends a few months ago (Fri, around 10pm)...  It is too loud, too packed, and drinks cost too much. I am certainly not one of the "beautiful people" who belongs here...  Good luck!
UNK:UNK It is great.  Great ambiance, food, and service.  I love the rooftop bar too.
UNK:UNK Just ok good in a pinch but not best!  I have learned to like that spicy sesame chicken,  I don't like it leftover though.  They also get points for very good behavior and treatment when I called in my order to the wrong location,  they called the other store and made my order at the correct location.
UNK:UNK We love this place. We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leave-in conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats (all for $22). SO worth it. Plus: all the employees are SO nice! And now that they are starting to carry her dog food (Blue Buffalo), we'll be headed to Wag N' Wash for her chow too.   LOVE.
UNK:UNK We absolutely love this place! When we get out for date night, this is where we go. The waitstaff are great and the food is delicious. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because we love it all....from the fried okra to the jambalaya...If you're in the area this place is definitely worth checking out.
UNK:UNK We like it. L and I 2nd date was here, and we made out outside. It was hot and sexy. Do we remember the wine? We love wine,but I remember the kissing. Kissing beats any 97 point wine. D.C. Ranch overall, just has not made it, for restaurants and retailers when I lived in Az. This has nothing to do with the restaurant just an overall impression to yuppie?
UNK:UNK LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)
UNK:UNK Wow.....  Not in a good way  The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives! P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!
UNK:UNK Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!
UNK:UNK I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
UNK:UNK Great establishment and especially for it being a chain.  The place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing. The prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups.  I like their menu it's simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot.
UNK:UNK I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.
UNK:UNK I love CK's. Their happy hour specials are great, service is awesome, and food is tasty. Try the adovada pizza...it's goooood.
UNK:UNK The staff were very friendly and the place was clean and didn't smell funny like some other fast food joints.
UNK:UNK Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
UNK:UNK My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!
UNK:UNK Not a bad place to go but not my first choice. The food is good but nothing unique or special.
UNK:UNK Sharp looking place modern meets old dinner, good food nice and simple breakfast menu. Staff could have been more friendly, but over all solid place will be back again!
UNK:UNK it's all about the queso fundido...and the jalapeno margaritas. trust me.
UNK:UNK Overall good place. Pizza was good and a great selection. The service however was really slow and non-attentive. Took 30 minutes after being seated to have wine and sodas at the table. Cute place, but the acoustics need some help, very noisy. Would go back if in the neighborhood.
UNK:UNK I liked this place. Great Atmosphere and music. Their Guacamole and Salsa is really good. Service was good too, My server (forgot his name) came by often to check on me (Or because he thought I was gonna run out on the bill) and was really nice. I had the Carne flatbread, surprisingly good! Id definitely come back when I have have the money  Good place for a date as well!
UNK:UNK Wow! Just left Apple with a new phone and I could not be happier!  Such a great experience compared to dealing directly with Verizon.  The employees were welcoming and friendly and helped me solve my iPhone problem quickly!
UNK:UNK Place is tiny and relies mostly on outside seating, and parking is a bit tough like everywhere in that area, but worth it.  The iced tea wasn't good, but the Southwest Chicken Sandwich was delicious...definitely recommended.    Parking a couple blocks down on Main in the art district was the best we could do after circling around..but the walk isn't bad.
UNK:UNK Great food and very knowledgable/helpful staff. A little expensive, but the food is definitely worth it Have had pasta on one occasion and salmon on another....loved them both. Will definitely be back to support this great restaurant!
UNK:UNK This place is exactly what a local coffee shop in Phoenix should be.  Lots of sunlight, good iced coffee.  (Also, apparently, they serve wine!)
UNK:UNK Great food.  Good service. Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.
UNK:UNK Great sandwich
UNK:UNK Update!  Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness.
UNK:UNK What a shame! It was a great place to hang out :(
UNK:UNK The only big Asian market in all of Phoenix which is, shockingly enough, located in the Chinese community center.  They have live fish and every canned good you can think of.  Want some canned unagi?  No problem.  Rice cooker that doesn't suck?  Got'em.  Some frozen shrimp balls?  Win.  They're pan-asian everything.. and if they don't have it, you're hosed!  This is the only game in town.
UNK:UNK Am ashamed to say I have filled up my punch card, twice.  Usually get the Hook and Ladder.  But the main reason I keep going back...the magical Coke machine of Awesomeness.
UNK:UNK A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.   With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner. They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
UNK:UNK THE LINE IS HELLA LONG!!! so is the wait!! other than that I thought it was good..... Oh yah phoenix is hot.... and you will be standing in line outside!
UNK:UNK We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again.
UNK:UNK I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited.   I was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't.   It is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.
UNK:UNK This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.  Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.  Service was off the charts!  We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!
UNK:UNK Great place.  Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
UNK:UNK M-Troniks repaired a 1970's Fender Bassman 10 for me.  They re-coned the speaker, letting the stock speakers remain.  They also replaced the tubes and adjusted them.  New longer cord as well.  They fixed this old thing up!    Crazy guitars for sale and other odds and ends.
UNK:UNK The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries, too greasy. Seating, not comfortable. Skip it!
UNK:UNK Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good.
UNK:UNK Good sandwich! Better than all the chains, doesn't beat Jason's deli, would like black tea (not green). Fresh tasting and clean
UNK:UNK i like the ooey gooey cupcake! the chocolate cake is soooo moist and cooked evenly in perfection. only it's served chilled? it's weird.   their cookies are good, too. I bought a tub of their easter sugar cookies and they are so stinking cute! they're very sweet though so it's impossible to eat more than 2 per day but soo good. anymore than that you'd need insulin. :)
UNK:UNK I went to sears today to check on a layaway that I placed online but was going to pickup here. Margaret, the associate couldn't find me in her system so she personally called the sears.com help line to find out what was happening. She was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful in solving my problem. I went home a happy customer and am very thankful to Margaret for her help!
UNK:UNK This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.
UNK:UNK Great food, great prices, and great service.  I am a big eater and could not even finish all my food for only 8 dollars.   The orange chicken was fresh and tender with excellent flavor.  The combo also came with fried wantons and spring rolls.  Super far from my house, but worth the drive.
UNK:UNK Yup. Definitely a fancy mall for that credit card burning session.  A combo of outdoor and indoor. You probably can find most everything the average person can't afford here.   It seems to be the spot for malling in Scotsdale.
UNK:UNK Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL
UNK:UNK This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. That's about it! Yum!
UNK:UNK the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me.  if the deal was right, i would definitely use this company again when visiting Phoenix!
UNK:UNK Lots of "gay on gay" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well
UNK:UNK I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me.
UNK:UNK Their Chicken Critter Salad's got game. More portion of chicken than any other chicken salad I've ordered elsewhere.  They have other great entrees, but this cowpoke likes his critters
UNK:UNK I loved this place! Amazing food and service. The servings are just right and very flavorful. Would highly recommend this place if you want a nice quiet dinner.
UNK:UNK I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.
UNK:UNK So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!
UNK:UNK A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands.  Mark Siebel http://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/
UNK:UNK Ate here again this weekend and I am happy to say that Fudd's has officially won me back.  The burger was positively delicious!!!!  And this time, I ordered the fries without the seasoning they add to it. Perfect! Hey, I'm a french fry traditionalist, what can I say? I hate weird seasonings or funky toppings on my fries (see review for Greek Gyro Express... and try to keep your cookies down).
UNK:UNK Great place for hippies, do-gooders and at this location an inordinate amount of old folks. I love the deli here. always a great sandwich at a good price. Although I don't see myself buying anything "soy" or "organic" or hippie friendly here I do like to shop here from time to time.
UNK:UNK I'm a value sorta guy...considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you won't find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic.  You will pay top dollar, but you get top notch stuff in return! Their baked goods are exquisite, their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh you'll ever see, and then.. there's the Beer & Wine. Wow.
UNK:UNK Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine.
UNK:UNK I've ordered cookies from Cookies by Design many times and they never disappoint. I have worked with this store as well as stores across the country when ordering for the people I work with and people I love. Everyone has always said how beautiful the cookies look but even better, how great they taste. You won't be disappointed. :)
UNK:UNK I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!
UNK:UNK Still not in love with it.  Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking?  meh.
UNK:UNK I've been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful! I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!
UNK:UNK Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!    If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!    Parking so easy and close as well.
UNK:UNK Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area. Congratulations!!! I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza. I enjoyed it very much. Neighbors please help our local business survive. We need them to support our local community.
UNK:UNK Parking can be annoying when it's busy, but the store is spacious and there are plenty of people to get help from.
UNK:UNK This is how Caribbean food should be done.  Excellent jerk chicken, perfectly cooked plantains, very good patties.  I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food.
UNK:UNK Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered "over hard" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places.
UNK:UNK Delishhhh... blueberry crepes w/cream cheese!
UNK:UNK Let me start by saying the crawfish ettouffee was the best I've had in a long time! The food itself should probably get 4 stars, however, our service was just plain bad, so I'm just going with 3 stars.  The outside patio area was really nice and they had live music and a bar outside.
UNK:UNK Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost.
UNK:UNK If you need a hat, this is where to go.
UNK:UNK Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy, and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland, disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later.
UNK:UNK Fresh and Easy's are great.  My only issues is how quickly some of the foods from this store go bad.  Don't buy for a week from now unless it is frozen!
UNK:UNK The black beans are awesome. Also recommend the jerk fried rice. Actually, everything I've had here has been good. Free snickerdoodle with every order. Oh, and the salsa is yummy too.
UNK:UNK Seriously good curry. Serious. I'm not joking. I'm serious, the curry is very good. Usually when a restaurant has pictures of the food on the menu I become suspicious (think of Denny's and Village Inn), but here the photographs are not indicative of anything bad. In fact, the food looks good. Did I mention the curry is really good.
UNK:UNK Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.  Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.  Our "go to" place for pho now.  Cheap too!
UNK:UNK Great location, great food, and nice ambiance.  The menu isn't huge, but this is a nice French cafe type setting if that's what you're into.
UNK:UNK This place made me remember why I don't live in Scottsdale anymore.
UNK:UNK Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind. Real good.
UNK:UNK Believe the hype. That's all I can say.   This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.
UNK:UNK Liked the theme, didn't care for the execution.  Portions were scant, prices not commensurate with value.  All three diners were disappointed.  Left still hungry.
UNK:UNK Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places.
UNK:UNK Large menu with huge portions.  Crowded, enjoyable atmosphere.  Great bakery. Somewhat pricey but worth a trip.  Food was good.  Had breakfast the Spanish Omelet & a breakfast sandwich made of eggs, bacon, cheddar on 2 potato pancakes; bagel with cream cheese.  All were fresh & plentiful.  Sandwiches are huge as well.  Offer "healthier" choices as well.
UNK:UNK Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it.
UNK:UNK great service, efficient bartender, the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski's nonstop...awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback...happy to see this little gem and will be back
UNK:UNK The best of all the Harkins. Better array of munchies and really friendly staff. Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases. At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat. Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po.
UNK:UNK Priceline had this resort as 4 star but it looks and  feels like 3. The employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs. Grounds are nice.
UNK:UNK This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience.
UNK:UNK Hadn't been before but my fiance has been going for ages.  I had the coconut shrimp, very good and moderately priced.  Very friendly service.  It'll definitely be a place I consider in the future, especially if I'm using the light rail in the central Phoenix area.
UNK:UNK Self service, good mix n match favors and lots of goodies. Be careful, the bowls are big and you can easily pay more for a single serving than a gallon of Breyers at the grocery store.    Very dog friendly place. They will bring out a bowl of water and a small softserve with dog treats stuck in it for your little dog.
UNK:UNK Let me first say that this is a nice place. The Chips and Salsa were some of the best I have ever had.   My Wife and I both ordered Soft Shell ground beef tacos. The ingredients were great and everything tasted very good. However I would like to note that the tacos were swimming in grease. Overall It was one of the better places we ate in the phoenix area.
UNK:UNK Love the drive up waitstaff on skates experience! They have happy hour specials with deals on drinks. I recommend the Cherry Limeade, so good, like a Shirley temple with a kick of lemonade added in.
UNK:UNK Food is top notch and within a good price range for a weekend breakfast.  I dropped a star because it's always so crowded there's usually a line to order your food.  That and they're closed on Sundays.  It's a perfect weekend breakfast, how can you be closed on Sundays?!  But I eat here all the time.
UNK:UNK ABC is the Home Depot for the baker or kitchen gadget junkie. They offer unique cake molds, cake toppers and my favorite- solid color cupcake liners.   They host a number of different Wilton cake decorating classes.  They close by 3:00PM.
UNK:UNK So happy Los Dos Molinos is in the east valley!  Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like that's a bad thing.  Great food & great prices!
UNK:UNK Quick services, a decent selection, and solid customer service.
UNK:UNK The burgers and fries here are pretty good, but the custard sundaes and concret mixers are amazing. The PBC & B i will go back for over and over again as well as try the other items. Great place.
UNK:UNK My mother always told me, if I didn't have anything nice to say, say nothing!
UNK:UNK great place to go and the pizza ia great too
UNK:UNK Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend.
UNK:UNK Wasn't impressed. Dressing tasted like a store bought bottle dressing and tomatoes very very mushy.
UNK:UNK Solid options for fast casual mexican fare.  Where else in a landlocked area like Scottsdale will you find a quality fish taco.  I definitely prefer this place over Baja Fresh, Chipotle, or any of the other usual suspects.
UNK:UNK I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club. I'll be go back. I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Hold'em poker. The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker. They have succeed.
UNK:UNK You can ride your bike! Yes, that right - take your bike with you - it's awesome.
UNK:UNK We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm.
UNK:UNK Love love love this place!
UNK:UNK Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. I'll be back march 10th!
UNK:UNK The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike
UNK:UNK I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called. We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS! Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great. We will definitely be going there frequently.
UNK:UNK Ok, so this is a Sprouts now. Boring. The layout of the store is pretty much the same as when it was Sunflower. I would like this Sprouts more, if it was like an actual Sprouts. Instead it's just a weird transitiony in between "Sproutsflower". That's what I'm calling it, until they figure it out. Atleast they still have the soup bar.
UNK:UNK I've been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!   I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself.
UNK:UNK My parents and I went to here after leaving a previous restaurant for poor service. Big Buddha was the the complete opposite! They were attentive, the food was steaming hot and delicious. Definitely recommend for dine-in or event take out. The Singapore Noodles and Honey Walnut Chicken are definitely must tries.
UNK:UNK PIECE OF **** manager wouldn't put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90. They just lost alot of business.
UNK:UNK It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place I've been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good.
UNK:UNK I used the drive thru early one morning on my way to work. I ordered a breve latte. It came as expected and was very good. A little pricey but I'm cheap. I hope this place stays in business. It's nice to have a neighborhood coffee shop that's not a chain. The drive thru option is great too.
UNK:UNK This is my go to place when I want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food. They have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients. Their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly. My favorite is the greek salad w/gryo meat, the dressing is awesome! I'm also a fan of the platters and spanakopita.
UNK:UNK Very friendly place to get lunch. Sandwich are good for a great price compare to what we paid back in Cali.
UNK:UNK The food was good but, for the price, there are a lot better steak houses.  For this price point, I would suggest Donovan's or Mastro's.
UNK:UNK This is one of my favorite spot to grab some clothes for the gym or work. I like the sales they have and it's usually pretty quiet so shopping is a breeze. Sometimes you can find good deals on the kitchen appliances as well, like the blenders for my protein shakes. The only thing I don't like about kohl's is getting hassled for a credit card every time I go here.
UNK:UNK Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in July.  I ordered the Spanish Scramble.  It was good.  I don't have much to say.  It's close to home but it's just okay.  Still looking for my go-to breakfast joint.
UNK:UNK Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?  You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!  Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.
UNK:UNK Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath.  Just had my first visit here and will be back soon.  The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly.  Too bad they aren't open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine.
UNK:UNK I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I get the same thing, the pollo fundido. It satisfies my Mexican cravings.  The atmosphere is fun, maze like. Service is decent and like most places if something is wrong they are quick to fix it. This is a great local restaurant. I love how it lacks the ultra corporate feel of most main-stream joints. Great Mexican!
UNK:UNK Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!
UNK:UNK Love this place.  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing. Love the atmosphere too!
UNK:UNK the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended
UNK:UNK The price is right! 16 bucks for two huge lunches, chips & salsa and two drinks.  If you're looking for upscale, squeaky clean and Scottsdalish, this ain't your place. If you're looking for good Mexican food, at reasonable prices, quick service and great flavor head on over to Carolina's.
UNK:UNK Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.  I blame the Diamondbacks, for no legitimate reason.
UNK:UNK I went back recently and noticed thatt the quantity of tuna they use in the sandwich has DRAMATICALLY decreased.  The bread is still as good as ever but it was a little disappointing to see that happen.  Hopefully it was just a once time thing.  Will keep you posted...
UNK:UNK After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.    I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.
UNK:UNK Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient.. They even have gluten free pizza crust. Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like
UNK:UNK I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!
UNK:UNK They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).
UNK:UNK This bar is now "Dodey's". Sold just under a year ago. *See "Dodey's reviews.
UNK:UNK Old school steak house.  Best 22oz ribeye I've had in years.  Bread drenched in broth was curiously delicous.  Waitstaff hustled.  THe only aspect was the salad, a waste but at Durants, there is so much good meat, why waste it on vegiies!
UNK:UNK This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve "tacos" at this location!
UNK:UNK Food was decent.  Overpriced for what you get.  Had 2 Distrito margaritas, $10 each.  You'd think for $20 you'd catch a little buzz.  Not sure any alcohol was in them.  I may go back if someone else offers and pays.  Otherwise, no desire.
UNK:UNK One of the best breakfast burrito selections in town.  My personal favorite is the breakfast supreme w/ red sauce ( and root beer the size of my head).  The decor may be meh, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.   They deliver, are always nice, and never busy (which is unfortunate). Definitely a diamond in the rough.
UNK:UNK "The Pilgrim" represented everything Thanksgiving. Turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, and onions  all in a crust. It was served with a side of cranberry sauce, and red wine gravy. I loved it.   It's a must try if you're around ASU. The only thing is that it's really small, but you should be fine sitting at the bar.
UNK:UNK Wow!  I enjoyed staying here!  Huge rooms!  We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room!  Highly recommended!
UNK:UNK This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it.
UNK:UNK I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful. The people in the shop remind me of the bay area. I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth. The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.  I strongly recommend this cafe!!!  Donkey-
UNK:UNK Spring Rolls - Great!  Singapore Noodles - Great!  Hot & Sour Soup - not so great - I have never had a hot and sour soup so dark!  Although the hot was hot and the sour, was sour - a little bit goes a very long way!  Definitely going back again, just skipping the hot & sour soup next time.
UNK:UNK Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
UNK:UNK This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.    The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  I've never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McD's that I've been to in this town.  Curse you McGriddle!!!
UNK:UNK 6.30 on a Sunday and there was a line snaking through the small shop. We took turns sneaking peaks at the day's options and by the time we got up front we were ready to order.  We got the salted caramel and chocolate marshmallow. The 1st was so good, the 2nd kinda boring. Can't wait to try more.
UNK:UNK Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?
UNK:UNK An industrial-chic bungalow built just inside of the Coronado Historic District that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting. The art and people are always beautiful.  Cappuccino, along with Caffe Latte are my two most common espresso drinks. This one today gets four shots of espresso. The cup is huge. The drink is excellent.
UNK:UNK We drive a little out of the way to go this target because it's clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent.   It's usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most.
UNK:UNK i don't understand the hype. it's very typical american chinese food. tried the bourbon chicken and it was nothing special - tasted very teriyaki.
UNK:UNK Great place for a "home office" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions.
UNK:UNK Not bad, but definitely not my first choice. If I were to eat pizza in the restaurant, then this is a good choice. But there are better choices for take-home pizza.
UNK:UNK Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us.
UNK:UNK This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company. The food is fresh and the service always friendly. If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go. Fondue is fun! If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.
UNK:UNK This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well!   Way to Go!
UNK:UNK They have a mechanical bull.  Need I say more?
UNK:UNK one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.
UNK:UNK Dined here last week and they have all sorts of foods and everything is ala carte; the place is a great place for all ages and their kiddie meals suit my boys perfectly. They mostly serve rice and their menu is also suitable for vegetarians since they offer a wide variety of choices. You will also feel that you really belong to the place since the staff is helpful and friendly.  So there!
UNK:UNK Pretty nice for an airport bar. Just had a bloody mary, but the food looked good.
UNK:UNK The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.
UNK:UNK great food, freaky good service, fantastic atmosphere.  Highly recommend sitting on patio, inside looked a bit loud.  Patio is fantastic, it is one of a few in Phoenix where it doesn't overlook a parking lot.  This is my new favorite place to take visitors.
UNK:UNK Although a huge fan of bloody food. I have to say, Green is really damn good. As a former cook at Spiral Diner, I always checked out veg joints in other states, and rarely liked any of it. Green is great. even the faux meat dishes, which are usually the least impressive. Keep up the good work.
UNK:UNK Their pizza needs to be in your mouth. BUTTERY crust. Like, butter buttery. And it's superb reheated at home in the toaster oven.
UNK:UNK Slow service inside.  Somewhat rude cashier, and for no reason.  Small and awkward layout inside, especially for the limited seating and limited standing area to take an order.  Sub-par as far as McDonalds go.
UNK:UNK Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
UNK:UNK Good mongolian bbq - more variety than most. They have some good sauces - Try the mongo bbq or dragon chili.
UNK:UNK Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.
UNK:UNK Hula's seems pretty hyped.  I had drinks here that were OK.  I had food here that was OK.  I'll try it again and get an entree, but I'll not likely go out of my way to make it here.
UNK:UNK Great bread and sandwiches.   Nimrod employees.
UNK:UNK If only they have more fresh produce I'd stop by a lot more often!
UNK:UNK The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.  Not bad.  They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.  That is all that you need to know.
UNK:UNK Didn't get to sit outside so a little disappointed.  We saw the "big assed burgers" and all decided to get one.  They were great but a bit messy.  Food and service were excellent.  Will try and get back for happy hour
UNK:UNK Similar to Desert Ridge.  All the typical chains are here. I like the Jimmy John's for a quick lunch.
UNK:UNK Saw CAKE there last year.  Nice grass, beautiful venue, great night!
UNK:UNK For opening night, there was a giant wave of people coming through the door.  The bar was dimmed in red and purple lights.  The bright new white dining tables were ready to be eaten on.  All new upscale posh furniture in the bar, dining area, and patio.  We were not able to get dinner but we'll be back.
UNK:UNK Awesome bartender on the patio! Way great drink specials!! Don't come here to have conversations, folks. It's LOUD!! Great DJ spinning crazy dance music. Place gets way crowded so get there early and snag a spot to people watch!!
UNK:UNK My wife and I just got married at Blackstone, and I'm still amazed at how awesome they are to work with.  Elizabeth, Megan, and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable.  The location couldn't have been better, I'm still getting compliments on how beautiful it was.  We read the glowing reviews prior to booking, and all I can say is that I agree with them 100%.
UNK:UNK Awesome pool.
UNK:UNK X
UNK:UNK Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
UNK:UNK Great place to go have a beer and watch the game on one of there numerous televisions.
UNK:UNK Awesome staff. Great prices. Left feeling relaxed and refreshed. A must try.
UNK:UNK Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?
UNK:UNK LollyPOP vintage is pretty sweet! They always have something I like and the service is impeccable. I dont think its too over priced, I mean this Phx not SF or NYC!! of course u will over pay a bit. duh. U should def check it out ;)
UNK:UNK I am a HUGE fan of micro breweries. Gordon Biersch is cool... a little "chain-like", but the ambiance is great.  I felt like I was under dressed.  I had the seafood cobb, which was awesome. They use REAL crab here... thank god.  Hubs had a large burger... he loved it and loved the garlic fries.   I had the Hefeweizen and hubs had a couple Schwarzbiers. Not bad at all.
UNK:UNK This place is so so.  Ok food.  Ok atmosphere.  Just a decent restaurant in Buckeye.
UNK:UNK yuk! service and food sucked never a gain!
UNK:UNK This is the place my friends and I go for Mexican food. Very tasty, affordable, and fairly quick service.
UNK:UNK The pho was good and a generous portion, but compared to most Vietnamese places... way over priced. The owner is very nice and entertaining :) The spring rolls were decent, but smaller than most places for the price. It still beats anything in the west valley.
UNK:UNK We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest.
UNK:UNK Best place around for sweet and sour chicken! The kids meals rock as they come with fried rice, a choice of meat and beef skewers. Did I mention their only 5-6 bucks? Little outdoor seating patio. The only thing we've found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls.  Good prices and food.
UNK:UNK The perfect burger. Awesome BBQ! NEVER a bad meal!
UNK:UNK Fun neighborhood bar, with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball!
UNK:UNK I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
UNK:UNK great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !
UNK:UNK Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx. And then there's the Pazookie...
UNK:UNK When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex. He is now 25 and still goes. I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day. He still goes and so does his 30 yr old son. My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going. These men compare this to a spa for men. Hot towels, straight razor shave, etc. Hey I should get commission lol:)
UNK:UNK The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!  Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...  don't bother with this place.
UNK:UNK Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!
UNK:UNK I have been here many times and have always had good food and service.
UNK:UNK That's too bad, but isn't it funny that I just wrote a review on Sportsman's!...lol  Not a bad replacement in my book.
UNK:UNK Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide.
UNK:UNK Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.
UNK:UNK Great place for dine-in and pick-up!  Ambience: Contemporary/ Casual  Food/Drink: American.  Good salads and desserts!
UNK:UNK One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix.  I love it.
UNK:UNK After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.
UNK:UNK Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.
UNK:UNK I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
UNK:UNK I ordered the BBQ sampler.  Chicken, pork, beef, and ribs!  yum!    Then I washed it down with their red cream soda and root beer.  yum!  Me = SATISFIED!
UNK:UNK Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.
UNK:UNK ...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!
UNK:UNK Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
UNK:UNK Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value.
UNK:UNK Clean facility, prices are super low! You can't go wong with saving money!
UNK:UNK I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.
UNK:UNK The pizza is just OK. Pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare. Get the lunch special, you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan. Would get it to go if I didn't live in the west valley. Good idea to have a separate take out door but don't count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around.
UNK:UNK Was here on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, the place was popping!!!  It is bright, colorful, and clean.  The menu is on the wall.  There are so many things on it.  I settled with a Thai Iced Tea Slush + boba.  The bobas were soft and a good texture.  I am interested to try the other items on the menu.
UNK:UNK 1 word. PIE!!!!  they have really good pies here, traditional, and some not so traditional...but still really good.   food is ok. nothing that will blow your socks off. i find it better in my freezer section then in the restaurant. pot pie is pretty good too
UNK:UNK veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
UNK:UNK Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink
UNK:UNK It was great coming to this store. It has a large selection of trendy clothes.  I will come back again.
UNK:UNK Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience.
UNK:UNK We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix! Service is fast and prices are good. The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!
UNK:UNK The Best hash brown casserole ever! My daughter loved the apples and sweet yogurt. The Staff was super friendly. going back this week
UNK:UNK Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste
UNK:UNK On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff.  Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.  What nice find in the downtown area. I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
UNK:UNK Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all.
UNK:UNK The wood saw is always out of service... The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little strange.  This location never seems to be busy, so check out times are short.  The prices are higher than "another" home improvement store just east on Baseline.  Meh.
UNK:UNK Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But it's not a chain, it's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas.  There's no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like).
UNK:UNK Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget you're there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!
UNK:UNK This place has a great selection of Korean dishes and even some Japanese.  This is a family favorite, from the stews, the BBQ, the bibimbop, to the side dishes.  The staff is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but always a great experience.  There is a sushi bar and you can either cook the BBQ at the table (2 people or more) or have it cooked for you in the kitchen.
UNK:UNK This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time.
UNK:UNK The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there.   First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious.   Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot.   My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic.   You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it.
UNK:UNK Yogi's is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - it's a great alternative for you sushi craving if you don't feel like spending a lot of money.  The quality of the food isn't bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - they've never done anything to impress me, but haven't done anything to disappoint either.
UNK:UNK The Chorizo gravy can be habit forming.
UNK:UNK Consistently horrible service.  Food is very good.  I used to shun corporate chains and opt for local offerings, but Babbo changed my mind.  They seem to hire servers who have little to no experience as servers, and frankly have no idea how to provide good service at all.  Just order it to go and you'll avoid this restaurant's downfall.
UNK:UNK I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
UNK:UNK -Inexpensive produce.  -Fresh sausage and other meats.  -$2.99 freshly made to order sanwiches.  -Decent prices, cheaper than Whole Foods.  -Parking is convenient.  -Employees in the produce dept not so friendly.   -Cashiers are usually friendly.
UNK:UNK Well I just wasted 38 bucks....never again
UNK:UNK I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
UNK:UNK My home airport and one of the nicest terminals in the USA! Great food, cool things to see and do, you just can't get bored here!
UNK:UNK I've always had good service here, but we usually do the curbside pick up - my advice is to just order a few toppings.  The crust cannot handle more than one or two - and if you get the pesto, avoid getting pepperoni plus other meat, it's so greasy!  (Good, but greasy).    Love the greek salad as well as their desserts.
UNK:UNK no chip manicure: no drilling, no filing, no damage, no dry time! we offer over 100 colors form opi , shellac, gelish, Experienced Tech, Professional service and Satisfaction guaranteed.
UNK:UNK I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.
UNK:UNK Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.
UNK:UNK The veggie sandwich was great. Not your typical sandwich with veggies in place of meat. Taste was actually taken into account. My meat eating friends even order the veggie sandwich. It's that good.  The waitress was very nice, personable and friendly.
UNK:UNK I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.  Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!
UNK:UNK I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this.
UNK:UNK Great sports bar!  Shows most UFC, Boxing and WWE pay per views.  Friendly staff, good food....  draft beer selection could be a little better, but other than that, one of my favorite local pubs.
UNK:UNK good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.
UNK:UNK Great ambiance, good food.  My husband and I had the Southwest Benedict and Eggs Benedict, both were delicious.  I do wish the eggs were a bit more runny and the food was warmer, but the presentation was beautiful.
UNK:UNK This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome
UNK:UNK This is the pub burger you have been looking for. Nothing fancy, just a good solid burger with a ice cold beer. Be aware this is cash only, but unless you fall in you wont need much.
UNK:UNK I love SAIL INN! Getting past the $8-10 cover on weekends is the hard part, but usually Sail delivers, 1) AMAZING LOCAL BANDS, 2) Laid back hippie, hipster,arty, folk vibe 2) cheap drinks, LOVE the little pitchers of beer - budlite for $4.25 on certain nights. Phoenix has a pretty lame music scene, but at least at Sail Inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd.
UNK:UNK Wow these folks know customer service!  We like the fact there are always managers on the floor keeping things moving and tables clean.  Food is good and at a good price point.  A nice friendly well run place!
UNK:UNK This location is great and there grooming service is good as well.
UNK:UNK Best in town!!
UNK:UNK Heather is awesome. She did my initial set of lashes and I've already gone back for a fill. Her prices are great and she does beautiful work! The compliments are rolling in. Absolutely recommend!
UNK:UNK I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
UNK:UNK Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.
UNK:UNK Great quality, great prices. If only they had longer hours, delivery of large items, and a gift registry, it'd be heaven.
UNK:UNK Most livable city my eye! Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.  Avoid at all cost.
UNK:UNK I haven't been here since they renovated but the previous decor was great.  Elegant open areas, great atmosphere.  Tried almost everything on the menu with the owners one night and everything was amazing.  I'd be there more often if it were closer.  They can also do private parties on their outdoor patio, and offer drink/music service.
UNK:UNK Not bad.  Very large story that has about everything you'd want, and open 24 hours.
UNK:UNK Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.
UNK:UNK All I can say is "yum!"
UNK:UNK Go
UNK:UNK The ambiance of this place is pretty great.  I made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date.  That way, if it is awkward, at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass.  The food was pretty good for the price.  The service was also great.  I'd happily go back again.
UNK:UNK Bevmo is very close to my house so I am here on a regular basis. I recentley found out Total Wine is opening and now Bevmo will price match their prices only.   My boyfriend has asked for them to put the Fosters Premium Cans in the Fridge and they said it was a corporate decision. They still haven't put them in the fridge.   The store is clean and the employees are helpful and friendly.
UNK:UNK I didn't have an outstanding experience in this place.  Breakfast was typical and service was rushy.    Solid 3 stars  Biscuits were yum
UNK:UNK Nice atmosphere. Good food. I had the buffalo on some fluffy fantastic foccacia bread. It was awesome. A combo with a drink and chips came to $9. They have free wi-fi which makes working or using your iPhone a pleasure.
UNK:UNK I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say.
UNK:UNK Excellent staff. Always knows how to make my drinks. Always remembers my orders every time I come in too.
UNK:UNK Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said.
UNK:UNK Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.
UNK:UNK I really wan to like this place more because it gets some of the best acts in town, but it is cramped, stuffy, the stage is too low, the sound quality is not great and they do not serve alcohol so the crowd is kind of stiff and non-fun.  I will keep going because as previously stated, they get some of the best acts in town, but... let's hope they work on the format.
UNK:UNK Ra Sushi offers average sushi grade.  This chain of restaurants offers a hip atmosphere with loud music and a great place to take down some drinks while eating.    As an Asian I'm a little more passionate about the rating topic for Ra.  If you don't have much  to say about a restaurant please think about rating it four stars.
UNK:UNK Went here with an Indian friend so I can't tell you what I ate, BUT it was tasty. We went 5:15pm on a Thursday and it was pretty empty, but as the night progressed more and more people filled the place out.  They do have a lunchtime buffet but not sure the price or quality of food, but if it's anything like the dinner we had...its worth checking out.
UNK:UNK I needed new tires & 2 months later my husband. Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise! I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot,
UNK:UNK The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.
UNK:UNK The green chili  pulled pork omelet  was delightfully good.  The coffee was great, and so is the decor.  The cream chipped beef and biscuits are also pretty fantastic.
UNK:UNK Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great.
UNK:UNK Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, you can get any bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20. It's a steal, and a delicious one at that.
UNK:UNK Wings + Beer + Football = LOVE  I am such a girly girl 99% of the time but come fall, I sort of turn into a dude.....  This is not my most favorite place to catch the game, but a good alternative when I want to mix it up or my team is on a bye week. Good selection of boneless wing flavors.  Oh god, just writing this makes me yearn for the season to begin!!!!!!!!!!!
UNK:UNK Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and I've never had a problem with the service.
UNK:UNK I stepped in for a quick lunch.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap w/ fresh fruit.  The location is cool, although I couldn't tell if they were actually open.  The food was tasty, the fruit was pretty good.  All in all, it fit the bill.  I wanted a quick, healthful, lunch and That's a Wrap provided.  I do wish they were open a bit later because I would love a wrap after a good night of drinking.
UNK:UNK Always drop by this place when i'm in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner.
UNK:UNK 5 star view... everything else is average... bar is small, food is ok, drinks are blah
UNK:UNK Food is great, but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore. I love their prime rib burger, if you have a few extra bucks to spend on the best burger in the world than go here.
UNK:UNK I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby.
UNK:UNK Unpretentious trendy spot in the middle of the pretentious downtown scottsdale atmosphere. Beers are 3-5 but it's worth it if you sit on the patio overlooking the canal. The place is very relaxed- Don't think many have found it yet. And the awkward waiters also make you feel comfortable... sorry Steve, you're awkward.
UNK:UNK Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.
UNK:UNK ...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.
UNK:UNK Great setting to enjoy good food!
UNK:UNK Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.  I also like that they are not "all over you" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door.   I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!
UNK:UNK Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!  Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.  Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.  Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.
UNK:UNK Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
UNK:UNK Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)
UNK:UNK These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!
UNK:UNK It's pretty clean little place good tacos enchiladas and tostadas but not big on the chilie beef really lacked any flavor.  Like another yelper said, they need a big menu board.  If I was near by I may or may not stop by, I'd prefer Some Burros for this type of venue .
UNK:UNK I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better!!!   The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies....oh my goodness.   Every time I'm in phoenix, this is my must go see do eat spot!!  The owner Frank is awesome.
UNK:UNK you will wait... ALWAYS...  I COULD EAT A POUND OF THEIR HASH BROWNS. i get them to go!
UNK:UNK Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service! Would go here again in a heart beat!
UNK:UNK Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.  This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.  We will be back!
UNK:UNK This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!
UNK:UNK The hula burger was awesome! Great service. The hostess is very kind and sweet. What a great find!
UNK:UNK Loved the scenic restaurant, right in the middle of the farm. My #1 spot for a weekend brunch.
UNK:UNK Red Velvet, Check Parking, Valet for Free, Check Ratpack ghosts, Check Fun People, Check Strong, yet good drinks, Check Good happy hour place, Check Been Around for Ever & Deserves it Rep, Check
UNK:UNK Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.
UNK:UNK Excellent service. Thankyou Denise! Food was excellent...the two of us shared the C4 salad and a custom and pizza with a cappuccino and a latte.  Everything was very good and the portions big!
UNK:UNK So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for "the icon" not on menu, but very good!  Love everything I had there!  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!  Wish I lived closer!
UNK:UNK I would eat here again. The breakfast is good but super fatty!  Be prepared to eat a meal that makes it so you do not have to eat for the rest of the day.
UNK:UNK Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one.  Always busy, and you'll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well.  Portions are huge, but no complaining because it's all delicious!
UNK:UNK One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :)
UNK:UNK Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili. superfantasticdeliciousness.  i've only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didn't like.  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite. Thanks, Louis!
UNK:UNK hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant
UNK:UNK Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!
UNK:UNK Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever.
UNK:UNK Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)
UNK:UNK Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!!  I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)
UNK:UNK I love this place for lunch or a casual happy hour when I am in town. The Chips are amazing. They are not your typical tortilla chips. Every basket has a sweet, spicy and regular flavor. The food will not WOW you but then again this is a laid back tex mex restuarant with good margarita's decent food but a really good atmosphere!
UNK:UNK Love this store!  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didn't have.  Love their halloween section too.  It's my one stop shop for parties!
UNK:UNK Burger was good, bun really soft and veggies were fresh. Sweet potato fries were very good as were the rings. I knock them for not having cheddar cheese, cant really have a stellar burger without it. The burger quest continues.
UNK:UNK Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!
UNK:UNK Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!
UNK:UNK i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?
UNK:UNK It gets all three stars for the view.  For the prices charged the food should be oh, so much better.  And the selection is very limited.  But if you are trying to impress a date, and aren't too hungry, this is a very romantic location...
UNK:UNK Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down
UNK:UNK I must be spoiled and realize that this is not a big grocery store. I tend to think the store is a good place in a pinch for Asian ingredients. Mostly, Chinese and Vietnamese products for those looking for Japanese products might have to go elsewhere. In a pinch it is great, hopefully with local support this store can improve.
UNK:UNK I really like this little dive bar and was quite taken back by the fact they were shut down yesterday. I'm a frequent visitor, and they have a decent selection on the jukebox (touchtunes). The food is typical bar fare, but decent.. got a kickin' deal on chicken wings on a Monday night. I hope they recover because they are the best thing for a dive bar fan in Gilbert!
UNK:UNK Great food, clean a bit old but nice
UNK:UNK great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game!  the drinks here are better than the bar food!
UNK:UNK I'd go back the next time I'm in town.  Its friendly in here.  My friends and I just went in here to peek but we were presented in glasses of rose.  It was good, so I checked their stores of champagne (I like it pink).  I should have bought a bottle but we were on our way to an interview or dinner.
UNK:UNK I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw that Country Market had a deli here. I picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad. When I was eating it my friend said it sounded like I was having a mouth orgasm because I moaned after every bite! If  you live in the area and haven't been here yet try the sandwiches they're great.
UNK:UNK Best Thai food I've eaten in the Phoenix area.
UNK:UNK Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!
UNK:UNK Love massages and facials!  I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.
UNK:UNK Haven't been here since 1997! Man, now all the memories are back and can't wait to get situated in AZ for a couple days! ;-)
UNK:UNK Great spot, but it get's wayyyy too packed! Sort of a double edged sword, if it weren't always so packed it probably wouldn't be such a hotspot, but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60% of the time it crosses my mind.  My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location...
UNK:UNK 2 stars for the drive through.  Everything else about this Starbucks leaves you wondering, "why don't you just get back in your car and drive down to the other Starbucks on Daisy Miuntain"...
UNK:UNK Eorth a trip for pasta or their salads. Both are wonderful. And if you like garlic they know what you mean when you say xtra garlic. They actually give you extra. Yummm. Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night.
UNK:UNK First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.
UNK:UNK Great pizza   We have enjoyed this place for quite a few years.   Ingredients are above average.   Love the fresh garlic topping  Tough to beat for quality pizza on the East side
UNK:UNK Love it here. Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp. Great food cheap price great service. Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
UNK:UNK This place is nowhere near where yelp says it is. It is at Chandler and Ray road not in the industrial area.
UNK:UNK PCG is an excellent place to relax for brunch. You will find courteous staff, excellent table service, and good food. The environment was very laid back and relaxing. Definitely worth checking out if your in the area.
UNK:UNK The pho is delicious, and the prices are fantastic.  Definitely a hole in the wall and very authentic (not much English spoken here).  Down side is that they don't serve beer (wha?! who doesn't drink beer with their pho?!) but otherwise 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will come here whenever we're on this side of town.
UNK:UNK it's tiny and awesome!
UNK:UNK ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.
UNK:UNK The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill.
UNK:UNK This is one of very few East Valley theaters that has online ticketing through Fandango. The auditoriums have true stadium seating, and the chairs are spacious, and comfortably recline. The arm rests are movable, so you can snuggle with your honey while watching a movie. The picture quality is amazing!!! I only wish this theater offered a military discount, like it's Tucson Cinemark counterparts.
UNK:UNK a little greasy for my skin but the presentation is organic and fun!  glitter, rubber ducks, bath fizzies and tons of soap make for a great one stop shop when you're shopping for those girlfriends you have who like everything.  the style is unique making it a fabulous place to take a peek in but just not for me.
UNK:UNK Although the boba here is decent (The Street on Dobson&Southern is better), I really just go here for the food.  The small menu consists of meals that are authentically Taiwanese.  The beef noodle soup ($5) is my favorite.
UNK:UNK The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California.  The crab puffs had crab, not Krab and were much more crab than puff.  The food was cooked perfectly and delicious.  I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork!!
UNK:UNK Thai House is a great find! The restaurant is very clean and simple and the food was fresh and tasty (and affordable!). I had the Pad Thai and Spring Rolls. Both were gluten free. It's a great place for a week night date night with my husband. I can't wait to go back.
UNK:UNK awesome and delicious place! good for groups!
UNK:UNK I will be very brief.......the food is fantastic,!!!!!  The service is hard to figure out though. Lots of staff but we were constantly looking for our waiter, the water guy, the plate remover guy. All seemed to be on break simultaneously. I strongly recommend eating at the bar until they get the staff better trained.
UNK:UNK Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.
UNK:UNK Great breakfast, great service. Yummy!
UNK:UNK The food was decent.  My friend and I had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub.  I know this is stereotyping but being served food my real Italians I expected more spice and flavor in the food.  The alcohol selection is small but has the essentials (beer and wine). I want to go back and check out the pizzas before I write this place off.
UNK:UNK Good food here.  Nice atmosphere.  Food a bit pricey, but if you share, it's not too bad.  The Pecan Bar is awesome.
UNK:UNK The best Vietnamese I have ever had. Very authentic menu (not even in English). Great service and knowledgeable staff. The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food.   Great for dining in quickly or taking home.
UNK:UNK I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service
UNK:UNK Family-run restaurant that serves extremely yummy Iraqi food. Go up to the register if you want take-out and they will help you figure out exactly what you want. The cook is very friendly and can do extra stuff for you just let him know exactly what you're looking for. If you're staying in the restaurant to eat, they have fast service and its always served hot. Very good food!
UNK:UNK Kale, miso, shrimp dumplings... all good
UNK:UNK Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
UNK:UNK DD has great food, friendly staff, and a wonderful patio. The breakfast menu is the best in downtown Scottsdale. DD is also great for lunch and early evening. The Happy Hour menu is a great value. I have been there many times and the food and service is consistently top rate.
UNK:UNK There is a Leinenkugel beer stand on the east side of the first floor heading toward Fatburger! SO so so excited to discover that! They only take cash though!
UNK:UNK It is a nice place. Actually when i have just come in, everything seems to look normal. Nothing different frm other nail salons. However, when a lady did manicure and pedicure for me, she did really good service. She always smile a lot, and made you feel comfortable. I will come back soon and tell my friends abt this salon cause they did a good job.
UNK:UNK Went here for lunch on a weekday and thought it'd be busier. The slower setting allowed for more personal attention though. The chef even came out to talk to us and gave us free samples of some of the desserts. The food was good, but didn't blow me away. I think it's a nice option for a snazzier (it's a little pricey) lunch with friends.
UNK:UNK Love the bar! The two guys that sing and play music there Wed thru Sat nights are just amazing.   Manuels' has very authentic Mexican food. Best enchiladas and refried beans around.   Bar is adorable after being renovated recently. Restaurant could use some updating.
UNK:UNK I Live close but will stop eating there. The service was slow, my friend complanned about a order he had and they said ow next time tell them to make it different for you?  Really then I ordered another simple California roll Took forever.  The Sushi is allright but the overall experience is worth driving somewhere else you lost me...
UNK:UNK Good to know they still have independent films and they chose wisely what to play. Unfortunately this location seems to be attracting 40+ yuppies! I was shocked to see how many middle-aged and even elderly were at Camelview. That was a disappointment :/
UNK:UNK Don't usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment. The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite.
UNK:UNK Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe.
UNK:UNK Fantastic place to have a vacation..love this place. Close to shopping too...
UNK:UNK AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour.
UNK:UNK This was the perfect lunch! I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese. It was SO SO good. The combination was prefect. There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back.
UNK:UNK Great shopping place for clothes, jewelry, art and home decor! One of those GREAT finds and the owners are really nice. It has boutique clothing at affordable prices, great atmosphere and FRIENDLY!!!!
UNK:UNK I want to make love to a cream puff sundae.  Maybe even marry one.  They're that good.  Other than totally awesome desserts, this pace is a dump. The g-damn flickering fluorescent lights give me a headache.  Go there for dessert, inhale it before the flickering lights give you a seizure then run before you get sucked into a shit-hole linoleum time-warp.
UNK:UNK 3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget!  Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!
UNK:UNK I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)
UNK:UNK I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic.
UNK:UNK USE to be the best Pizza in town. Unfortunately that was like 10 years ago. Now this place is overpriced at about $10 for 2 slices and a drink. Trust me you can find better pizza almost anywhere and they charge for ranch as do most pizza places. But isn't a pizza joint charging for ranch the same as a burger place charging for ketchup?
UNK:UNK The BF and I got coffee here last night as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix!!. The coffee was alright, not too acidic, but not the most flavorful coffee, but the main reason for the 4 star review is they are open late and they deliver! How awesome! The people who work there were all friendly. The ice cream looked good...will have to try in the future.
UNK:UNK Pats is predictable. In the retarded amount of times that I have eaten there, i've never been served pizza i'm unhappy with. Best pizza slices in Arizona with good prices. Generally stopping by for slices is the easiest way to find good service with little to no wait.   Not always the friendliest workers, but that doesn't make my pizza take longer or taste any different!
UNK:UNK I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.
UNK:UNK I'm a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as I've tasted, and I've eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes -- all in the name of research of course.  Keep 'em coming, Tammie!
UNK:UNK Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!!
UNK:UNK You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!
UNK:UNK This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!
UNK:UNK This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwill's prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help.
UNK:UNK A little pricey for the portions but the flavors are outstanding. Homemade horchata is like my nana used to make.
UNK:UNK This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
UNK:UNK Average airport.   I wish gate Marques listed which zone was boarding. There were three airplanes loading at the same time and it was near impossible to tell which gate was loading which zone. We just waited a few minutes and rolled the dice that our zone was loading.
UNK:UNK Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher. He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person. He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana. He is very knowledgeable about different subjects. What I like best is once he said, "here you can do nothing wrong."
UNK:UNK The hotel is a throw back in time - friendly people and nice simple resort.  Love the free shuttle in the local area.  The restaurant though is not bad, but the service can definitely be improved especially at breakfast time.
UNK:UNK Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; you're really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!
UNK:UNK I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!
UNK:UNK great salads and burgers!
UNK:UNK Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's "Woohoo" again for this excellent restaurant!!     :-))  (See previous review for more details.  Weekday Lunch Buffet is still $11.99/$10.79 Sr.)
UNK:UNK My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently.
UNK:UNK I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Don't skip go in---even if you don't buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,
UNK:UNK They had what i was looking for ... it wasn't easy to find but after asking 3 people I eventually found it. A folding table and shelving. The place is typically big and laid out like most other home depots. Know what to expect when you go and you won't be disappointed but if you want a lot of personal service stick to a local hardware store.
UNK:UNK Worth the drive and more!!  This absolute gem in the west valley is exactly what we need to have and support.  a family owned business that is TOP NOTCH!!  The food was exquisite and the service responsive and attentive.  I am a HUGE fan.
UNK:UNK This spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick. Always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me.
UNK:UNK It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .
UNK:UNK $8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.
UNK:UNK Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me "that couldn't happen" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt.   I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last.
UNK:UNK Gotta get the hot wings! They'll make sure you know what you're getting into, but even if you haven't had them before, just play along. They're worth it.
UNK:UNK Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food.
UNK:UNK I've stayed at several hotels in the Hyatt Place chain and they are all great, but this one in particular stands out as having the friendliest, most helpful staff.
UNK:UNK This place has a fancy exterior and you definitely pay for the ambiance. Definitely a sit down with a napkin in your lap kinda place. I have tried the tikka masala, pakuras, vegetable korma, and naan.  It's all very delicious and the portion sizes are bigger than expected.   Drawback: kinda pricey. Not a good place for cheap take-out.  I ordered out for 3 and it cost $50!!!
UNK:UNK Ordered the mushroom burger, they put canned mushrooms on the burger. Gross! The patty melt was good. But it's really hard to mess up a patty melt. My salad had a bug in it.  Service was nice. And they do have a yummy cider beer.
UNK:UNK Love their pizza!!! Very fresh. Their cannoli was really good too. They seem to have great selection of wines.
UNK:UNK Great sliders, come on all you can eat night!  Bakery is awesome, ribs are ok, free breakfast on your bday!  No clue how adam richman did the slider challenge, I wanted to cry after 10.
UNK:UNK I really enjoy this place for a relaxing dinner.  They really know how to do a great salad and it's defiantly a plus when it's half off bottles of wine night.
UNK:UNK I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesn't seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.
UNK:UNK I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.
UNK:UNK Free samples? One dollar churros? Cheap buys? Why not.
UNK:UNK Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
UNK:UNK Food was good, service was great! If I didn't eat at Chili's so much inn the past, I would definitely go back, but since coming back to the US, many more other restaurants to try.....
UNK:UNK Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
UNK:UNK Love this place. Everyone is fantastic. The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect.
UNK:UNK The veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots!
UNK:UNK Went and got some delicious Boba today. Mango and Strawberry Banana.  Guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly. :) My choice place for quick to go Boba.
UNK:UNK WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!
UNK:UNK Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasn't my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again.
UNK:UNK I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place.
UNK:UNK I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices.
UNK:UNK I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!
UNK:UNK I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!
UNK:UNK Fresh and delicious.
UNK:UNK Glorified panda express  With that generalization aside I was willing to give ol PF Changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor  Thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal I alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium bombs there dishes when I read the nutritional info   'tear
UNK:UNK Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!
UNK:UNK Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..  NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!
UNK:UNK I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.
UNK:UNK Pastrami tasted good, but had a lot of tough tissue, and was near impossible to bite through. Rye bread was low-quality.  Curly fries were tasty.  Cole slaw was yummy! Really the highlight of the meal.  Lemon bar was delicious, if a bit subdued. (I like the lemon to pucker my face)  The brownie was warm and chocolatey, but too many nuts.  Probably my only visit, unless someone invites me.
UNK:UNK Wings in Buffalo aren't usually breaded. I can't stand breaded Buffalo wings. The sauces were good, I can't deal with the breading. The redeemer for this place is that they serve Roast Beef on Kimmelweck. I did not try it, I am sure it was decent though.
UNK:UNK Stopped there for breakfast. A cozy little place, with very friendly and smiling persons. Their house coffee is fine, but will have to go back for a dirty chai. I had also a bagel (just like any other). A nice drive through, and a good alternative to start the day!
UNK:UNK This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!
UNK:UNK What a great place. We (family of three) went on a Sunday afternoon. What a fun place, great food, friendly staff. The manager was there, she let my son sit on the michanical bull. fun. fun. fun
UNK:UNK Love this place pretty decent sushi for a good price, I love that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour. They're even open till 2am for when I'm craving sushi for a midnight meal:) Only reason I gave it 4stars is that the service is slow sometimes
UNK:UNK freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for...and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter...oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck.
UNK:UNK Blah  Food is boring and sub par in my book  The ambiance is chill and super trendy Scottsdalish  The drinks are all old time drinks.  Think Slow Gin Fizzes, Rusty Nails and Manhattans  The service is good though
UNK:UNK Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more "exotic" things like the lengua and menudo!  You must go!
UNK:UNK One of the best dining experiences we had in Phoenix. And what a surprise, without Yelp we would have never found this wonderful "hole in the wall" in a space the width of a bowling alley. I had The Italian which was Pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes & marinara wrapped in a delicious pastry shell. Imagine a gourmet hot pocket. Mmmmmmmmmmmm
UNK:UNK I have been coming to Lai Lai's for many years now and have never had a bad experience!  The food is always great, and if you mess it up you have no one to blame except yourself since you decide what all you want in your bowl lol.  Sometimes I don't make it in for a year or so but the staff always remembers me and that makes me feel very much at home.  Lai Lai's is great!
UNK:UNK Everything I have had here has been wonderful. Very fresh. The service is good. The food is wonderful. I have eaten at this one and the one in Glendale. Excellent food in both locations.
UNK:UNK I've only been here once, for breakfast, but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon!
UNK:UNK We went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the Suns game. Fresh fish sandwich was delicious, as well as the shoestring fries. Great service, nice vibe, I'd go back.
UNK:UNK Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.
UNK:UNK 5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS  This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.  Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.  This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix.
UNK:UNK Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!
UNK:UNK Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!
UNK:UNK Had my Snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park!!! Clean and would be perfect for walking a dog! There's lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown Phoenix how nice! Real Arizona feel! I would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning :)
UNK:UNK Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!
UNK:UNK Still not much hair to cut but Helen does a good job and has developed a following of both men and women.  Don't spread the word or I will have to wait longer.
UNK:UNK Food is just 'eh... Just one more sushi place of many
UNK:UNK i liked this place. small inside located inside old town glendale so it looks sorta cute food was gooood! got the sampler combo cause i didnt know what to get and the cheese and potatoes pierogi were yummm!!  recommended!
UNK:UNK I like it here.  The pizza is pretty good, the wings are awesome!  Lots of good deals to be had here and the service has always been speedy and courteous.  Very easy to feed a large group for not a lot of cash. I agree with the below comment.. very clean place, even the ladies room is nice and clean (hard to come by)  which is very much appreciated.
UNK:UNK Food was good. Service was not good. Only one waitress for entire restaurant.
UNK:UNK Our go to pizza place! Don't see how they could improve in any area. Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!
UNK:UNK Once again, the pizza was delish. They were super busy last time I went, and my gf and I had to wait a while to see a server, but they apologized for the wait, gave us two free sodas and were understanding that we needed our food to go ( Kick-Ass started in like 30 minutes!).  Very cool.
UNK:UNK I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.  The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future.
UNK:UNK I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.  They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good.
UNK:UNK I know this is going to be super girly but I love the peach beer at Four Peaks and the beer battered fries are amazing.
UNK:UNK Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!
UNK:UNK The chicken shawarma is stellar. I get it to go at least once a month, substituting veggies for the rice. Slightly pricey, but you get a lot of food and it's very consistent.
UNK:UNK Great lean pastrami and cole slaw. Marble rye and challah were a little bland and dry. I always appreciate diet Dr. Brown's cream soda. Overall good lunch spot and handy location.
UNK:UNK Probably not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely in the top 5!  Had the groupon deal of 50% off, so that made it even a better experience.  Not exactly the atmosphere for a "date night", but the quality of bread/sauce/toppings is fantastic.  If you like specialty beer and pizza, there is no reason not to try this place.  Will be returning for sure!
UNK:UNK I have been to Lux a few times now and it has completely won me over with its delicious coffee and mouth watering chocolate croissants . There always seems to be a line but it moves fast. Among the numerous coffee shops in the area, Lux definitely stands out.
UNK:UNK Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 10 Food 9 Service 10 Atmosphere 8 Value
UNK:UNK The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was clean, quiet, serene.
UNK:UNK This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through.
UNK:UNK The food is good quality. The atmosphere is nice. The owner and his wife work hard to make you feel welcome.  Skip the chorizo gravy, everything else is a solid B.
UNK:UNK First off nothing gourmet going on here at all. Its basically Subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place. It's cheap, generic, flavorless food.
UNK:UNK Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.
UNK:UNK Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish.   Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food.
UNK:UNK A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!
UNK:UNK Love Abuelos! Best Mexican food!
UNK:UNK Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. I'd hate to see her take a sobriety test.
UNK:UNK BBQ Chicken plate is excellent! My wife says that the half order is fine. Usually take orders to go and food is ready on-time! We eat here on a monthly basis.
UNK:UNK O.K. , I actually like this theatre, why ? well because it is usually never crowded. Things are a little old and outdated, but I hate waiting in line, so this works well for me .
UNK:UNK I've always had consistent quality of food and service here.    Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  I've been to this specific location about half a dozen times....  I recommend City Hall or Mastro's (N. Scottsdale), over Morton's.  But between Fleming's and here, it's a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Fleming's over Morton's.
UNK:UNK Very good food with huge portions.
UNK:UNK Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!
UNK:UNK Potbelly, you have been handed the torch.  It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise.  I love italian-style subs.  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.  The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).    This place is my new go to sub shack.
UNK:UNK Great food and atmosphere. Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Had the pork pita which had onions, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese...awesome...  The burgers are good too! The service was excellent.
UNK:UNK Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
UNK:UNK Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area. You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go.  HUGE selection of loose leaf teas. If you're a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do.
UNK:UNK I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint!   These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3" square) brownies you will find!   I'm tellin' ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!
UNK:UNK By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too.
UNK:UNK Delicious, cheap (for how much you actually get), and oh yeah, delicious.  I LOVE this place. I easily take home enough food for 3 meals. Great variety and nice people.
UNK:UNK I love that it's all a self serve line. You pick your yogurt and can mix flavors and then add any other toppings you want! Fabulous!
UNK:UNK I tried this place on a recommendation of a friend. Their frozen yogurt is really good. The peanut butter flavor was rich and creamy. They also had a wide array of toppings. The only downfall is they were a bit pricey. I had the small cup whcich was not even full but once it was weighed cost almost 4 dollars. I would still say very yummy and worth trying.
UNK:UNK I hate Thai food and I'm not a huge fan of curry but this place has changed my mind. Very reasonably priced and always a great option at lunch because they handle the traffic very well. Not only am I back on the Thai bandwagon but my favorite dish is the green curry seafood.
UNK:UNK Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..  It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!    their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!  I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!
UNK:UNK I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.
UNK:UNK Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.
UNK:UNK I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.
UNK:UNK This place not recommend, food was cold, rice was soggy, lettuce wilted, and beans runny.
UNK:UNK A great place to experience some unique and innovative dishes.  The Stetson Chop, of course, is the highlight of my Cowboy Ciao experience, as it tends to be for many others.  But I've also had good luck trying other things on their menu, such as the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a less expensive alternative to the entree version.
UNK:UNK I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup. Holy Heaven in a cup. We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I can't speak to the actual restaurant. But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup.
UNK:UNK I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
UNK:UNK I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.
UNK:UNK This place is GREAT! I must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex. The sushi was awesome, the drinks were very reasonabally priced, we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice, kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar. The service was great! We will definitely be going back.
UNK:UNK I love their food. Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is "Bahn Mi" inspired fish sandwich. Get it with a side of kale salad!
UNK:UNK I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!
UNK:UNK Not good. Very bland Thai food, ugh, the two words do not belong together, bland and Thai! The Peanut sauce was the worst ever. The Pad Thai and Tom Ka Gai soup were blech. Fresh rolls large but no flavor. The service was decent though. Just disappointing.
UNK:UNK Charming cafe and it doesn't matter what you order. Breakfast - Lunch - you can't miss.
UNK:UNK had a "cap steak" for the first time. Best steak i have ever had.  Would recommend to anyone.
UNK:UNK this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!
UNK:UNK Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
UNK:UNK Great Happy Hour. Get the TACO BASKET~! Thursday-Mexican Beer $3
UNK:UNK Such a great oriental market!  Unusual fresh produce and aisles of every kind of noodle and sauce.  Fresh fish.  The only disappointment is we read on Yelp that they had sushi grade fish and they DO NOT.  Boo!  The only thing they had was frozen smoked eel (Unagi).  We will definitely shop there often and it was a fun trip for the grandkids-
UNK:UNK I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month. Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed
UNK:UNK This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasn't all to impressed, but this location is a whole 'nother animal.  Plenty of space to do you.  Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders we're super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale.
UNK:UNK This place is classic goodness! Everything tastes rich and fresh! Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare. The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks! In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office. An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!
UNK:UNK For some reason, these people seem to think it's OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50.   They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I can't over-repeat, is the devil.
UNK:UNK This salon is really cute. Fridays are 1/2 off single sessions and this is why I keep coming back. I use the level 2 bed and on Fridays its only $5 to tan. I wouldn't come here if they didn't have that though because membership prices are ridiculous and the customer service isn't that great.
UNK:UNK The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong.
UNK:UNK Great bagels & bialeys!  Service was great, food was fresh, bagels & bialeys were like NY! I'll be a regular here! Also check for specials on Tues & Fridays
UNK:UNK We visited last week.  The lady offered us a lot of samples of their food so we could pick out what we liked.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  The restaurant was very kid friendly.
UNK:UNK Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.
UNK:UNK Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
UNK:UNK Excellent service and great quality.  I will always bring my alterations here.  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!
UNK:UNK This is the best Pho I've found in town yet.  Good spring rolls to, the sauce was a little to runny though.  I hit this place up 3 times a month to get my vietnamese fix.
UNK:UNK Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics I've ever been to. He is caring to all of his customer's and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on. I cannot recommend him strongly enough!
UNK:UNK It's like being a Target girl but recognizing the value and prices of Walmart... so I don't make a point to shop here (vs LeeLee's with greater intl variety), but when I am in the area... I frantically think of what is low in the pantry so supplies can be restocked at a minor savings.  The pricing is marginally cheaper -- to clarify, the auto 10% discount is calc off the non-sale items.
UNK:UNK I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho!  The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness.  Very cost effective= CHEAP.
UNK:UNK Nothing special about this place.  Clean and the food is okay. I go because my one son loves it.  Have to keep the kids happy.  Never had a bad experience but never had anything stand out either.  My fav dish is the Spinach artichoke dip.
UNK:UNK Perfect greasy food for the night after a bender, or a family breakfast. I'm cool bringing my 10-month old here because it's noisy and with so many other kids around she pretty much goes unnoticed, except by the nice waitresses.
UNK:UNK Amazing greek food! Definitely try the greek fries!  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.  Staff is also always very friendly!  Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!
UNK:UNK Always good pizza, close to home and they serve beer and wine.  Plus my kids can play video games and husband can watch the game.
UNK:UNK Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place
UNK:UNK The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.    Babbo is much better.
UNK:UNK Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.
UNK:UNK I found this on yelp and what a great wine bar! I went here last night after work with friends and we shared a bottle of wine and had sandwiches. It was so good can't remember either name of the wine or food. It was very small inside which made it cozy.
UNK:UNK My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!
UNK:UNK Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-
UNK:UNK Outside the treats, you get an adorable and sleek interior which is very comfortable and feels great to be in, and fun people watching to boot. Its a little expensive for the drinks - I figure that comes with the territory.
UNK:UNK Yummy, creative sandwiches!  Good prices.  Highly recommended.  Service is generally a bit of an issue, so if you are one of the prissy eaters who doesn't understand that serving can be tough, you'll probably get your panties in a wad.
UNK:UNK Fresh bread....awesome beans!!! Raspado...tostitos!!!!
UNK:UNK best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.
UNK:UNK Great Bellini, loved the Seared Ahi, Portabella and Beef Tenderloin Flatbread and Spinach and Artichoke dip! I highly recommend you select the same on happy hour! 3-6pm 7 days a week!
UNK:UNK the food was okay, it's a bit pricey. I liked the big wood boat they served our sushi on. not my favorite but don't hate it either.
UNK:UNK i love trader joe's!!!   i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it.  the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!
UNK:UNK I've been here twice, great decor, cute & really friendly staff, and lots of really nice people to shoot the bull with. I've heard the food is really good too, but haven't tried much of it yet. I did try the french fry basket, it was nice and huge, and the hot wings are good, they use Franks, so if you like reg hot, get the hot. Happy hour specials are a good value too. Will return often.
UNK:UNK Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. That's what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.
UNK:UNK I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience.
UNK:UNK food is good ,but they have to re-model those bathrooms they are piss soaked and the smell makes it all the way to the dining room oooff!!!!!
UNK:UNK A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!
UNK:UNK Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect.  I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food.
UNK:UNK I've never had a bad meal at Z-Tejas.  My favorite is the Jerk Chicken Salad, but I've also had some great scallops there.  The cornbread is always delicious, and they're famous for their margaritas.
UNK:UNK First time having Scandinavian food, everything was excellent. Will return soon.
UNK:UNK This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for. You cannot go wrong with this place!
UNK:UNK This seems like a decent place to get a drink, if youre so inclined, before going thru security.   The service was so so, but I also think our waiter was in training. We didnt venture very far into the actual restaurant, just sat at one of the pub tables by the enterance to keep an eye on the security line, so I guess its good for that as well.
UNK:UNK These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!
UNK:UNK Good coffee good location, but not a place I'd want to hang out. It's not that inviting to me for some reason. That said, I do really enjoy their coffee!
UNK:UNK This place is your standard hole in the wall pho. They've got good tasting pho and spring rolls for cheap. :D The cleanliness is definitely lacking but more flavor fo' yo' noodlee!
UNK:UNK As good as all the others, and closer to home than most.
UNK:UNK I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.
UNK:UNK The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying "have you guys decided yet on what you want?", uhh yeah! Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back.
UNK:UNK Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music. All the bartenders are really nice and that's always RAD:)
UNK:UNK This place is great.  They have the best veggie burger - yes veggie burger - that I have probably ever had.  It is spinach based and has chopped jalapenos in it for some kick.  When I buy an entree, my kid eats for free.  So not only is the food good but it's very fairly priced as well.    And much better than the regular Big Fat Greek Restaurants around town.
UNK:UNK Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too.
UNK:UNK Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.
UNK:UNK It was an OK gyro for almost twice as much as the other places I've been to. It had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage (that's what "gyro meat" is, fwiw,) and was pretty tasty, but not as good as a $4 gyro at Ali Baba. The price you pay for location, I guess.  This would have gotten three stars, but then it gave me indigestion all day and I couldn't eat dinner, so it loses some for that.
UNK:UNK Had the spicy beef lunch plate with four sides. It was outstanding! Great kimchi too.
UNK:UNK Amazing bagels and a great staff. I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!
UNK:UNK went midweek and were seated right away  Table was clean, service was adequate but food, meh. Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast.
UNK:UNK I really want to gives this Sprout's location 4 stars but over the past few months when I get a deli sandwich the bread has bean stale 1 out of 3 times I'm there so I can't do it. If this Sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread I'd be happy.  On to the rest of the store.... Sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.
UNK:UNK Well laid out zoo.Space good for animals...More for kids than adults. Zoo had limited number of animals...who were bored,listless,hiding mostly. Water ponds for animals were stagnant with algae! All in all Not a great experience. They are going to expand it seems...but they should pay more attention to the  animals they have .  Celtcharm
UNK:UNK No, I don't want to take the bus to get to the train.   In my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isn't effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho.
UNK:UNK Love sitting at the sushi bar, the chef's are always super friendly and really fun to watch. The urchin with the quail egg is a MUST for all you sushi lovers.
UNK:UNK 2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.
UNK:UNK Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location.
UNK:UNK Jan Ross has one of the best selections of crystals I've seen - they literally had every crystal I was looking for, and I subsequently left as a satisfied customer. Friendly staff too.
UNK:UNK I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open.  You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!
UNK:UNK Burger was delicious and fresh. Fries were well seasoned and crispy. Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation. Fun and good! Definitely coming back.
UNK:UNK The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.     The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Don't be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  I'd be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up.
UNK:UNK Recently moved from the East Coast. So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco. I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza. It's amazing. Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot.
UNK:UNK I wandered into this store while wandering down Mill on a Saturday afternoon and what a pleasant surprise it was. Their design fit perfectly with my tastes and I wish I had the extra cash to redesign my house with their products.   The salespeople were friendly and helpful, but not pushy. Great experience!
UNK:UNK I love fro yo!! This place is near the light rail when you get off on mil. The have lots of favors and a great topping bar. Yummy fruit toppings including mochi and those boba balls that squirt out juice lol. I will be back a little pricer than the normal fro yo shop but also a great spot on a hot day and near asu :) I also liked how you could make smoothies with the fro yo and fruit :)
UNK:UNK I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!
UNK:UNK I've eatin' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mia's is the Best I've had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!!
UNK:UNK There is something for everyone on the menu. It's more than pizza. The service is great. Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain. I will keep going back.
UNK:UNK Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect!   The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99.
UNK:UNK Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations. On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment.
UNK:UNK I have only eaten here once, but i cannot wait to go back! the service was phenomenal, the potstickers huge and delicious! the orange beef - just as good as a pf changs!  I had a restaurant.com coupon, purchased $10 gift card for .80 cents!  Highly recommend!
UNK:UNK Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend.  I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since I've come to AZ, I've never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here.  The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know you're at an authentic place.
UNK:UNK Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance
UNK:UNK Decent gelato.  Some real, some artificial flavors.  Comparable to Gelato Spot, I guess.  Nowhere near the same league as Arlecchino, though. However, any place that doesn't use 100% real fruit, chocolate, etc... will never compare to Arlecchino.  If you're already at Tempe Marketplace, MDG serves the purpose.
UNK:UNK Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!
UNK:UNK Fun dive bar.
UNK:UNK When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?  I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?
UNK:UNK Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous.
UNK:UNK Love it!  It was pretty far away from my home in Glendale, but I think it was worth the trip.  We had girls night here a couple weeks ago.  We had a cute waiter, who helped us with our wine choices.  We ordered 4 different types of bruschetta and they were divine!  Will defiantly come back even though it was a little pricey It still wasn't that bad considering the quality.
UNK:UNK Hit up this joint a couple times while in town for Padres spring training the past several years .. it's great sports-theme hangout for large groups .. plenty of TVs, service is very good, food is decent, big variety of drinks .. but it can get a bit pricey here for a casual place.  Location is convenient for those hanging out in the franchise capital of the world--Peoria.
UNK:UNK Friendly service. Ordered the Veggie burro. Should have gotten 3 friends to help me finish it.
UNK:UNK clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.
UNK:UNK Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!
UNK:UNK The Sushi was fab!!  We had some specialty rolls and Shashimi, both were very melt in your mouth fresh!  Service was a bit slow as I think they only had 2 waitresses for the entire place.  Cost seemed to be very reasonable.  Would certainly make the drive from South Scottsdale there again!
UNK:UNK This is the king of asian buffets! The price is a little high but its worth it. This is one of the few buffets were everything you try and put on your plate is good. Service was excellent well, especially for a buffet.   P.S.=You better watch out for me in the lines cuz I'm ruthless when I get in buffet mode.
UNK:UNK this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.
UNK:UNK I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
UNK:UNK Delicious. Can't be the pricing on the lunch menu at a sit down restaurant. Great interior decor that doesn't scream Chinese restaurant. So far I've had the House Special Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were great.
UNK:UNK The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!
UNK:UNK The actual bar (especially the outdoor area) is really pleasant in the cooler months.  That being said its also near the university so can be overcrowded with snotty hipsters at times.  A good place to socialize with reasonable prices, and oysters, yum.
UNK:UNK Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette.   The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.
UNK:UNK Food was ok. Servers ok but cashier was horrible! Ok, some people are just not meant to work in the food industry. At least smile!   Place had a very gross smell! At first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got!   Maybe if I'm desperate enough I will go back!
UNK:UNK confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc  Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :(
UNK:UNK It is ok Mexican food, not bad but is overpriced for what it is.  I don't understand why this place is packed every night of the week.  The food does not warrant the crowds.  I'm baffled.
UNK:UNK Tooooooo crowded!!  That takes all the fun of the place. As a mountain is a nice place to go up without feeling that you will loose your lungs. Going down feels faster than up. Being in regular shape it took us about 50 minutes to go up. A moderate hike and doable by all the family.
UNK:UNK It is a cute little restaurant, has a nice wine list.  I ordered the Linguine with clam Sauce, and a glass of pino.  Personally i think the food is actually pretty good, nice northern italian.  But the service was just ok.
UNK:UNK Best Vietnamese food I've had, and I've been to some very good Vietnamese places. Very fresh and delicious.
UNK:UNK Hmm-Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I was indifferent. I like the decor and if I could give it a half a star just for having an outdoor dining area, I would. The menu left a lot to be desired for me. We went at lunch time so I don't know what the dinner menu looks like. It was just ok. Nothing blew me away. It's nice for people watching and has a really nice location.
UNK:UNK Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!
UNK:UNK I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer.
UNK:UNK Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.    The staff was great and super friendly!  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!!    Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades
UNK:UNK The tuna sandwich is fabulous!!! Definitely visit this place!!
UNK:UNK This place wasn't that great for the price.  I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea (basically bar food over priced) Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn't equal out to what I paid for.   The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasn't that friendly.  Definitely wont go back here again.
UNK:UNK I had a mammogram completed on 12/12/10.  This facility has been covered by my health insurance for over a decade.  But not this time.  The doctor terminated his contract with the insurance provider on 12/01/10.  Screwed for $300.
UNK:UNK Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!
UNK:UNK You know what the 'bucks are all about, get a Venti for the long flight you won't regret it!
UNK:UNK Very old-school. Large portions and friendly staff. Good salsa and fresh chips.
UNK:UNK This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.
UNK:UNK Tried this place for the first time and had the chicken pho and and mongolian beef with red rice. All was delicious...but I especially loved their red rice, it was spicy and soooo good. Everything is very reasonably priced and you can even get it delivered from a service called You Buy and We Fly!!
UNK:UNK Pretty nice sports bar. A lot of nice tvs. Food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices. Would stop by again if I was in the area.
UNK:UNK There are definitely better places to go to in Old Town. Overall Martini Ranch is usually pretty slow and charge a cover to get into an empty place. Last time I went there my friend and I got our cover back because it was so dead. They do have good martinis though.
UNK:UNK I have stayed in this hotel a few times. I think overall it's good. I am happy with the golf view. The restaurant is alright.  Update 9/7/07 - I stayed over at this Hotel again....really great customer service!
UNK:UNK The best !  From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place. I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans)   The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced.
UNK:UNK I didn't know what to expect from this store. It was over 105° so I wanted something cold! You get samples to help you or confuse you in to many choices! I went with the basic: cookies& cream mixed with vanilla carmel. Do yourself a favor & get the large so you can mix plus go on Thursday for double stamp day!
UNK:UNK Absolutely unbelievable!!! This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe! But get there early as they close early and run out of food! It's so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I love French pastries, crepes and desserts! The macaroons melt in your mouth. I will be returning soon!
UNK:UNK Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
UNK:UNK Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!
UNK:UNK Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...I'm sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b
UNK:UNK We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often. I love their food, the service, and also the atmosphere. My favorite's are the bun dishes, I always order the no. 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend. Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends, mine have always enjoyed the experience.
UNK:UNK Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.  Give this place a miss.
UNK:UNK I visited Sala Thai with a friend and I had the Pad Thai.  Food was pretty tasty and very filling.  It had a nice tang but I might have preferred to have a fork and knife to cut the very long noodles with.  Other than that I'd definitely visit again.
UNK:UNK I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great. The happy hour menu was amazing too. $5 Mark West Pinot Noir! The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay. Great experience! Definitely recommend the calamari too!
UNK:UNK I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*
UNK:UNK Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for?  Ribs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare.
UNK:UNK always consistent quality and value. we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous  home of TX, and we still are big fans!
UNK:UNK Great great happy hour! Fun atmosphere! Great decor and best garlic edamame in the valley!
UNK:UNK I visit this Subway several times a week. Staff are very friendly. Good customer service. Ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh. It's a standard Subway but differentiated by friendly staff and good service.
UNK:UNK If it would be closer to my area, I could give it one more star.   Their special of $4 burgers is a good way to call your attention. The best was the service, the lady that took care of us was really friendly and nice. Another time I'll have to try their food.
UNK:UNK Fun place to get masks for all my robberies.  I joke. but really you can get good masks at Easley's.
UNK:UNK Hip hop sandwich shop.  Not a traditional dining experience.  Food was great, and prices were very great.  Everything on menu was under $10.  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious.   I look forward to going back again, and probably again.
UNK:UNK Not terrible.  I got the drunken noodles and pad thai.  Not the best, but not the worst.  Maybe I'll try them again and update my review...
UNK:UNK Friendly, fast service. Got an excellent 20 oz. caramel cappuccino for $4.50. Just wish it were easier to get to when you want to just run in.
UNK:UNK Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
UNK:UNK Love this place. Every time I come here its like a high school reunion. There's wonderful people and a perfect atmosphere for drinking.
UNK:UNK I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it! I'm always happy with the results. My nails don't lift or chip. I have also had a facial their and it was amazing. It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips.
UNK:UNK This place is great. It is very clean and the staff is very nice and accommodating. Every time I walk out I am completely satisfied with the work.
UNK:UNK I absolutely love this sub shop! Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich! I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it! Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer! MUST GO!
UNK:UNK This place is a lil bit of awesomeness! The food was great, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice! What's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service.
UNK:UNK This really is more of a lady's hardware store with more design/decorating stuff, small appliances, and such. But this time they had something HD didn't, and at a good price.  Almost exactly what I was looking for, too.  Even if you're a die-hard HD shopper, it doesn't hurt to check here too.
UNK:UNK They do a great job! My old dry cleaner was always destroying buttons on my shirts. Never happens at Titan. Friendly staff, too. Also, good place to have alterations & shoe repairs next door...in the back of a barber shop.
UNK:UNK Great date place! I was worried that I wouldn't like what they picked for me because I don't like vegetables but the chef worked right around that. The cheese plate was very good but the bread that it came with was fantastic!! The short ribs were great. I loved all of my wine pairings as well.
UNK:UNK We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!
UNK:UNK The single best ribs I've ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  I'll be back here!
UNK:UNK Very good food served quickly.  Add a little hot sauce and some soy sauce, mix it together.  Eat.  Price is low and quality is high.  You really can't ask more than that.
UNK:UNK love dicks, richardsons etc etc but come on I'm throwing down 120$ get some  servers / managers with customer service skills.
UNK:UNK Priced Decent, Quantity Heavy. Just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips. I love chips and salsa, but this was too much than i thought. Anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic Mexican flavor to it. Worth a short once, particularly if you are pretty hungry.
UNK:UNK I absolutely LOVE the food from The Pitic! The place does look rundown and it is a rough neighborhood.. however those are the best places to eat aren't they? Food is made fresh to order and out of the 10 or so years I have been coming here the quality of food never changes. It is great for families and actually anyone looking for a great mexican meal. Their crunchy beef tacos are to die for :)
UNK:UNK Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun!   Insider's tip: ask for some real wasabi!
UNK:UNK Good rates Great location- near food, shopping Quiet area Rooms have kitchens Free Wifi and Breakfast  For a business traveler these are the big selling points- it's kinda basic but loads of features.
UNK:UNK Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!
UNK:UNK Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine
UNK:UNK Good food and freindly staff. They have a nice selection on the menu. After seeing the table next to me I wish I'd of had the house specialty....blueberry pancakes. Next time........
UNK:UNK I really like this place and would definitely come back.  I had a blueberry martini that was dreamy and for dinner I had the halibut entree which was also very good.  Their wine selection is very good... I did have a glass of wine too because someone ordered a bottle of wine and I felt compelled to help him out:)  And from what I remember the service was also very good.
UNK:UNK This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.
UNK:UNK **********This Time We Didn't  Do Carry-Out**********  Definitely better ......... when you eat there. This place is like Pei Wei ........VERY LARGE chunks of meat. Vegatables ...... NEVER.......Just like Pei Wei........their priceless.  WARNING: Hot Tea is available for $2.00 *********Brown Rice instead of White ......... ALSO $2.00********** The Soups are TERRIBLE.
UNK:UNK I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!
UNK:UNK This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.
UNK:UNK This in truth had been my first "Cajun" eats.  The atmosphere was cool. The service was good. The food was rich and filling.
UNK:UNK Clean, comfortable, smoke-free, fast service, nice staff.  Also, their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items. There is juice and coffee; bagels, yogurts, waffles and cereals.  The hotel was a lot nicer than I expected, and I would definitely stay here again.
UNK:UNK They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.
UNK:UNK My dog is very difficult and they do a very good job handling her.  It did take a few times before she got comfortable with them.  I am glad I found The Doggie Door.
UNK:UNK Meh, I'm not completely sold.  It's so much smaller than a traditional B&N and they did not have anything I was looking for. Nevermind any of the school related supplies I would have like to seen.  I don't think I'll come back here, I'll make my way to Borders (yada yada as you will). I won't be going to the next nearest B&N (Tempe) because I don't have a car and the energy just isn't worth it.
UNK:UNK If you're in the neighborhood, it's not full of skivers having a session. Service was friendly and ample. Food was good. Exactly the pub we needed to find. A chat with a local Barney, the jig my daughter ripped into was heart felt, live music, and a boxty that tastes like my dad made it.
UNK:UNK I was really surprised by this place!  Soooo much better than that other "bertos" place!  I went thru the drive thru so I'm not sure about the inside but I ordered the taco and cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans. I also ordered a side of chips. The food was very good and the rice was REALLY good!  The chips were hot!!  Loved it!  Yum!  I will be back when I'm in the area again.
UNK:UNK We took our grandson (Sebastian) to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit.  Sebastian wasn't too sure about the carousel, but the train ride put a smile all over his face.  The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults.  Sebastian liked it too.
UNK:UNK Food was pretty good but my biggest issue was with the service. We made a reservation and still had to wait an hour. Isn't the whole point of a reservation...so you don't have to wait an hour? One of the three hostess, tried to help at the end of the wait but by then all we waited was to eat/drink. All in all, I enjoyed my chicken and bbq ribs but would not go back.
UNK:UNK Great prices and fresh food ...
UNK:UNK Meh.
UNK:UNK Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.
UNK:UNK I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.
UNK:UNK My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond's visit and while I couldn't do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th.  The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great! Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out.
UNK:UNK A nice place to watch a game... nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives.  I also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time.  Anyway I don't have a good reason to give this place one star, or five stars, hence three stars.
UNK:UNK This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I can't get over the fact that people rave about this place.
UNK:UNK Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. There's not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices.  The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low.
UNK:UNK I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.
UNK:UNK I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken.
UNK:UNK Have been there several times. I'm quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn, so my continued custom says it all.
UNK:UNK A real gem!
UNK:UNK Amazing food! Great waiting staff, and the drink I ordered was very good and had the right amount of liquor. I will be coming back to this place for sure!
UNK:UNK Unprofessional, disorganized, and extremely low end care.
UNK:UNK The service was great, but like all the other Fox concepts you pay too much for mediocrity. The short rib stew was good. The ribs were cold and the chicken pasta was bland. There are just so many better options in the area... What a disappointment. But I should have known better.
UNK:UNK On my second week receiving a small mixed box for Nature's Garden and LOVE it!  It is more than enough for my fiance and I.  It is the easiest way to get fresh, organic, and local produce, especially since it is delivered right to my door.  It helps learn what is in season and how to make great new recipes!
UNK:UNK delicious! def got the sandwich Adam on Man vs Food got! i think it's called Del Reys! it was sooooooooo good and the sandwich was huge, the price was great! however, there was a long wait, so I'd say be patient for their services!!
UNK:UNK I love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world, some strings, or a new guitar, the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers, (in a good way!) every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great "mom and pop" feel.
UNK:UNK Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha  See ya there!
UNK:UNK Ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic. They did a great job on the remodel, so it's a lot more open than it was before. They have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful. We will definitely go back!
UNK:UNK Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
UNK:UNK It was one of those lazy nights and we wanted something quick to eat. The place was surprisingly  busy. It's off of Shea Blvd. I don't order their noodles because the last time I had them, they were over cooked. The food came out HOT and we shared our plates. I ended up taking the leftovers home and had another meal the following day.
UNK:UNK Lots of people to help but too busy talking to each other...so, I left...
UNK:UNK They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there. Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena. It is out of this world. It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner.
UNK:UNK Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!  Guilt free conscience! What more could a girl want? I am in LOVE with the dosas.  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food. Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free. Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations.
UNK:UNK Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.  C'mon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding.
UNK:UNK Love this Cold Stone if only for the fact that around the time you would be leaving dinner in one of the close restaurants, the strip mall this location is in is basically shut down. We didn't have any wait whatsoever.
UNK:UNK Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional. They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend this office.
UNK:UNK Very good food. The tepanyaki was great!  It does have a certain atmosphere though. Remember to dress appropriately. It can also be a bit pricey.
UNK:UNK Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature "fry-pieces",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!
UNK:UNK Love the food here.  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.  Thai iced tea was great as well.  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.  Service was fast, prompt and nice.  Will be back again to try other dishes.
UNK:UNK Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs. Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!
UNK:UNK This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas.  I don't plan on returning.  There are better places near downtown Chandler.
UNK:UNK I went to Tuck last night because of the reviews on here, and I loved it.  It really is tucked away and all the better.  It feels even more special.  We had the panini bites, dates stuffed with chorizo, and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  Not your greasy comfort food here.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more.
UNK:UNK Had a coupon so decided to have lunch at Wildflower. The food was pretty good, similar to other specialty bakeries. The cashier was not super friendly, but the manager was. Would go back, just felt that nothing overly stood out about this place.
UNK:UNK I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out!  Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not "act".  Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun.   Lawannah Curry Phoenix Az
UNK:UNK Good JIB. Fast an friendly.
UNK:UNK The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.
UNK:UNK This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.
UNK:UNK I wasn't sure what to expect. This was stop 1 on the pub crawl.  There was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons (they looked like regulars) The artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic, but the place didn't have a dark feel.  I can't say this would be "my" bar. But if I were in the neighborhood I would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus.
UNK:UNK This is a bit far from us, but we went and we had a great time. I loved browsing the local goods, and the fact that it's pet friendly was a huge plus in our book. The old lady who our dog sniffed, on the other hand, should probably take a chill pill. I also got a great bunch of fresh basil from this place, which had excellent aroma and taste.
UNK:UNK Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!
UNK:UNK I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food. The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy. Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side. It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.
UNK:UNK Superb beer selection. Music was really nice and at a good volume. Really a great place to hang out and have a drink. We missed (aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime) a jazz jam session. Will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because I miss me some good jazz. It's so hard to find in Phoenix!
UNK:UNK Upscale restaurant on-site at the Wigwam. The hotel's location means that there are few full-service restaurants close by - so we chose to eat here. We were very glad we did!  Service is great - fast, friendly, and prompt. Food was terrific (ribeye for me).  Would definitely eat here again.
UNK:UNK Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add, with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.  Way to keep it classy over there.....
UNK:UNK I would recommend a visit if you happen to be in Scottsdale. Papago has a beer for every type of beer drinker. They have 100's of bottles in clear panel refrigerators, and 30 taps some of which are house brewed. They have a great beer selection and awesome wings. What more do you need from a beer spot?
UNK:UNK I am from New York and always asked where do I get best pizza? Hands down Lamps Pizzeria is the BEST!!!!!!  Always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner.
UNK:UNK I decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in my Savvy Shopper magazine for 25% off. I am a fan of all of the little self serve yogurt places popping up but I must be honest that this place is no different than all of the rest. Be careful that you don't overload your cup or you will end up paying a lot by the time they weigh your dessert!
UNK:UNK Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go.  The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use.
UNK:UNK Umm this place is awesome. I got a bike basket for 25 cents. 25 cents! Too often these days I run into "thrift" stores that miss the thrifty part, but not this one! It's fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal!
UNK:UNK Went here tonight on a date with my BF.  I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, service, and food.  All the ingredients were fresh and yummy. The Chow Mein was the best I have had in years.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   I would give the one sushi roll, Golden Cali Roll, we got a 3.. it was just ok. The BF liked it more than me.
UNK:UNK Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go.
UNK:UNK They are wonderful!
UNK:UNK I prefer Petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices. I like Petco for their cookie bar so I can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets. That's basically it, I only shop here on occasion because of the location. Go to Pets Inc in Tempe instead for a real shopping experience.
UNK:UNK We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ.
UNK:UNK great wine selection except they are always out of greg norman and ive never got to try it
UNK:UNK Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
UNK:UNK I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.
UNK:UNK Meh.  Seems to be a little expensive for what you get.  Nothing "wowed" me at all.  Many places similar to this one give you better food, and more of it for your money.  By the way - I tried this place TWICE and had same experience both times.
UNK:UNK This Baja Fresh really didn't impress me.  It's pricey considering that all you're getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesn't have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since it's a corporate chain you can't expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.
UNK:UNK They play two kinds of music here: country and western.  The place is about the size of my one bedroom apartment.  It's a dive for sure.  It's cheap though.  But cash only.  The food is actually not too bad for bar food.  Overall this place doesn't impress much, but considering you don't have a lot of choices for Laveen, you can't really compalin either.
UNK:UNK Pretty good place.  Separate bar area upstairs with lots of TV's for sports.  Nice size portions.  A little pricey, but big portions.
UNK:UNK Coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets, I have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint. This place is legit! Good tacos, good burritos, real good non-taco bell mexican!  If you want some real Mexican food, try this place out!
UNK:UNK Love the carne asada.
UNK:UNK Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale.
UNK:UNK I haven't been here in a while.  I like how they have remodeled this Fry's, even though it is not even 5 years old, they revamped it a little.  Today they had awesome deals for certain participating items.  I am glad I read the flyer I got in the mail.  I am glad I have their VIP card, I got a lot of stuff for only $45.
UNK:UNK My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load. Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places. He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well. Excellent customer service and very friendly. Thanks again, Gary
UNK:UNK Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for.   The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite.
UNK:UNK Pretty good place.  You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you.  The service can be slow at times which can get annoying.  The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street.  The food was so-so.
UNK:UNK Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here.
UNK:UNK Finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef pho....darn it was good!
UNK:UNK Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too.
UNK:UNK I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!
UNK:UNK Made an appointment on the day I went. I only had my lunch break, but they made it a worthwhile and affordable experience! No hidden charges for the exfoliating salt scrub. I received a beautiful pedicure in a clean atmosphere in under an hour. Success!
UNK:UNK We've eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food.  All of the servers we've had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything.  No complaints and we'll definitely be eating there again.
UNK:UNK Went in midweek for lunch with a few guys from work. Place was quiet, easy to get seats. Staff were super friendly and efficient.  Some of the best wings I have ever had... Try the boneless wings, hot, and "Finished on the grill"... AWESOME!!! Also highly recommend the patty melt on marbled rye with sweet potato fries.
UNK:UNK Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho.
UNK:UNK A very  good sandwhich shop!  My boy and I stopped in here after a movie at the AMC.  They have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items.  My only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety.  I am not always (rarely in fact) in the mood for a toasted sandwhich.  The italian sandwhich I got though was delicious. NOM NOM NOM
UNK:UNK Love this place! Wish we had one here in CA. Great vibe once you walk through that door. Fantastic drinks and goodies!!
UNK:UNK Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
UNK:UNK The folks here are the best!
UNK:UNK Eat, drink, be merry.  Love the atmosphere. Love the upholstered loveseats, love the bruschetta and salad. Love the open air.  Don't love the horrid parking options.  Don't love when I'm seated on the wooden chairs. How can we be expected to relax and drink up when our bums are bruising?  Servers? Easy on the eyes. Nice bonus for girls' night out.
UNK:UNK I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco.
UNK:UNK Festive with a deep beer list. Great set up if you like live bands delivering music from up on high while drinking micro brews. Lots of tv's and pretty good selection of Az brews.
UNK:UNK This place has really delicious, insanely fattening brownies.  They are really quite delicious, although they are pretty pricey.  They do have really great sales, though!  These make great thank you gifts to people (we've sent quite a few) and we haven't had a flavor we haven't liked!
UNK:UNK Romantic, quaint, amazing! We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals, and we were so happy we took their advice. We ordered a white pizza, a anti-pasta appetizer, and bottle of Chianti. We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere! Perfect date spot...
UNK:UNK Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways.   We arrived/departed on time both ways. My normal sized butt still fits in seats so no issue there. I enjoyed my free drink and chitchat with the flight attendants. Brought my own snacks and read a book. All in all a good beginning/end to a relaxing vacay with the man friend.
UNK:UNK Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.  The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle.   One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).
UNK:UNK I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!
UNK:UNK Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
UNK:UNK Awesome.  So much better than parking on site.  Safe and good prices keep me coming back.  Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day.
UNK:UNK More a comment than a review. Suffice it to say, I L-O-V-E this store! Much to my surprise and delight they are opening a second store at 75th and Cactus! Right in my own backyard , don't ya know. Woo hoo! Now all we need for the NW valley is Lee's sandwiches, and a solid dim sum joint to complete my favorite Asian trifecta!!
UNK:UNK The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!
UNK:UNK I would give it 5 but, I want to try it again to make sure. Very tasty Mole. good drinks. Great atmosphere. Excellent service.
UNK:UNK Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.
UNK:UNK Definitely a solid choice for some quick healthier alternatives.  Good Wraps with quality ingredients.
UNK:UNK Love the charm of the place. I only wish they had a burger that did not taste as if it were boiled. And yes, I tried this place a couple times wanting to like it.
UNK:UNK I went here for a birthday party it was a group of 9 and everyone got good service. It was good in taste but more expensive than some of the ones that were closer to me in Mesa. I would go back but only as a group. If you are closer to this place than say Sushi Ave go here you wont be dissappointed.
UNK:UNK I have eaten here twice now and this place is phenomenal!  Great price and amazing food.  I highly recommend the baked ziti!  I will go back at least twice a month.
UNK:UNK Chicken schnitzel was amazing. Service was slow and server didn't know the menu. Didn't know what a knish was.
UNK:UNK I've been going to this place for years, and they have always stayed true to their own style.  The place is a bit shabby, but the food is delicious. Their prices are decent, not too expensive not too cheap.  The staff is friendly enough, and if anything ever goes wrong, they have no problem fixing it.  All in all, a good place to grab a slice of pizza.
UNK:UNK I know... I know... it's Phoenix but I expected something far better.  Perhaps my mistake.  Located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills, no cart, and no nonsense dim sum experience.  Don't think I will be going back (for many reasons) but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do... just dont expect much.
UNK:UNK Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
UNK:UNK Truly a great place!   The flights are FANTASTIC! The food great!  Service also great!   Try this place! --- Seriously the fewer words to describe the greatness the better.
UNK:UNK How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.
UNK:UNK We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register
UNK:UNK I used to frequent this restaurant years and years ago. I was a student at the Deer Valley airport, and eventually a flight instructor as well. It was a great location with awesome views. The food was always descent the the service was great.   Nothing too exciting, but a great place.
UNK:UNK Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)
UNK:UNK This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.
UNK:UNK Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
UNK:UNK Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!
UNK:UNK Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
UNK:UNK Fantastic pizza for the price! One of our favorite take-out spots. Ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings, soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza. Great deals, great prices and quick service. Not a place to go sit and eat - strictly take-out.
UNK:UNK Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back.
UNK:UNK Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
UNK:UNK I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.  Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.  Such great people at this location especially.
UNK:UNK Had lunch with my Husband here today, we sat outside, it was gorgeous weather, the food is really Great, good variety, of ethnic foods !!!  Not bad for the price !!!
UNK:UNK Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!
UNK:UNK Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks.
UNK:UNK The best Chinese restaurant in the east valley in all categories from Dium Sum to banquet style dinning. Their steamed fresh fish with ginger scallion is my favorite. I have been coming to this restaurant for 5 years and never had a bad meal. recently, they even invented some new dishes for the weekend luncheon carts.Tthe stir fired radish cake with bean spout is delicious!
UNK:UNK The Pho was delicious, the place was cute, and the prices were decent. Also, the service was amazing! The waiter offered to warm up my son's bottle. Good service goes a long way, so we will definitely be back!
UNK:UNK Get to the airport early and relax with a nice drink and some tasty food at Chelsea's Kitchen @ Sky Harbor Airport.   Good beer selection.  Tasty appetizers.  Wait staff is friendly.
UNK:UNK When I came here I got half a dozen donuts and one of those boba drinks. The donuts were really good, but I wouldn't say they were any better than a Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. The boba drink was so good though! I'm really happy they have those. :)
UNK:UNK The best way to get coffee is through a DRIVE THRU! And that's the beauty of DB. You can just drive right back and get a coffee beverage.  I had an iced peppermint mocha concoction that put me back about $4. A little steep but it was huge. I think the gal said their iced drinks are only one size.   I still think Starbucks is better but DB is a close second.
UNK:UNK i've never had a problem getting assistance here, except when it's busy, usually on a sat/sun. it's not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if i'm in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff.   they've offered groupons here and with those, i've bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!
UNK:UNK Youfit is always very clean and the staff is really friendly. Trainers are not pushy if you don't want to be trained. The only downfall was when I signed up it said unlimited tanning, but they have no tanning beds. All in all though I am comfortable there and don't feel like it's a huge pretentious gym. I was made aware of the yearly service fee and which month it would be charged as well.
UNK:UNK This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.
UNK:UNK Had some amazing cuisine at Milagro's. The chef is truly an innovative genius. Our food was so unique and delicious. Plus, the weather was so nice that we sat out on their beautiful patio and watched the sunset on the purple mountains. I highly recommend the PB & J appetizer. It's nothing you have ever had before I can assure you. I would also highly recommend the swordfish dish and tacos.
UNK:UNK Beef gyros are always good here.
UNK:UNK I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty.  I'll make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK.
UNK:UNK For a sub shop, great place.  Delivery is freaky fast for sure.  I order delivery half the time.  Pro's - fast delivery - quick service if ordering onsite - staff friendly - food is good  Con's - No WiFi.  Would like since AT&T service spotty near this building.    Good spot.  Glad there is a location here.
UNK:UNK high quality sushi fish. expensive. good atmosphere. good service.
UNK:UNK Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.
UNK:UNK NEW LOCATION FOR 2012:  Portland Parkway in Downtown Phoenix, Portland St. & Central Ave, right across from the Roosevelt Light Rail Station!   Saturday, November 12, 10am-4pm  Find more info here: http://www.localfirstaz.com/fall-festival/  Bigger location = more fun!
UNK:UNK Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value.
UNK:UNK I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant! PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!
UNK:UNK So the place has Christmas lights, and a fair amount of ambiance, and supposedly there's a shirtless shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it.  Other than that, the service was less than lackluster, the domestic kegs all seemed flat.  In other words, go somewhere else unless it's 1:00 and you want to see some daytime nudity.
UNK:UNK Crazy busy on a Sunday morning @10:00, sat at the bar..quick service..both ordered the Calf. Benny,  Next trip the pork carnitas. Waitress recommended the Southwest carnitas which looked awesome. Great place for breakfast/brunch.
UNK:UNK Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt "Up scale Mexican Food" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.
UNK:UNK Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.
UNK:UNK yumtastic!! just don't forget your safety whistle and pepper spray! ....even during the day....
UNK:UNK This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.
UNK:UNK Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.
UNK:UNK Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.   Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list.
UNK:UNK You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!
UNK:UNK I'll be back!   Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her!   $20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards.
UNK:UNK For a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job, in fact mabe the best one in town for me. Most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu.   BJ's has a great gluten free options. the pizza is very good, probably the best I've had in town. good selection of beers. service is always pretty good.
UNK:UNK Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too.
UNK:UNK Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix.  Accutemp has a new customer for life!  Highly recommend!
UNK:UNK Some hits and some misses.  Hits : bruschetta and salads  Misses: Pizzas other then the margherita (luckily though I got the scrumptious tomato and mozzarella pizza)  Great service and pretty good food.
UNK:UNK Great breakfast!  The rest of the menu however is average.
UNK:UNK Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit.
UNK:UNK Not too many video stores around.  I will probably be joining Netflix soon, but for now this place works as a video store.  They have movies Redbox doesn't have yet, in addition to older movies Redbox will never have.  The service has always been good here.  My girlfriend has the mail in deal so movies are mailed to her then you can take those and exchange them at this place for different movies.
UNK:UNK Fantastic restaurant. Service was great. Food was excellent. Their happy hour from 3-7 is great. 3.00 entree's.  Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.    Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce.
UNK:UNK I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.
UNK:UNK If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.
UNK:UNK Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work.
UNK:UNK We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
UNK:UNK Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.  *** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!
UNK:UNK The food wasn't phenomenal but it was very good. The service was excellent. The decor was very cool. A good experience. Great selection of wines by the glass. Very pleasant experience.
UNK:UNK I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale.   Pro's quick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable).   cons,  the salad dressing is quite sharp.
UNK:UNK This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. The food is great with many vegetarian options. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice. Highly recommended
UNK:UNK Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!
UNK:UNK Nice place...Need more restaurants..! Pretty huge airport...so long walks..!
UNK:UNK Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.
UNK:UNK 1. Good Customer Service 2. Clean Atmosphere 3. Good Margaritas 4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito
UNK:UNK I can't speak to the selection, hours, owners, or resident cat. I can tell you that we noticed an 'honor system' as we walked by tonight with our Mojo. An honor system in this day and age?! Yes please! Friend and I both picked a $1 paperback, shoved our bills under the door, and walked away feeling like winners, a silent invisible transaction between fellow bibliophiles...absolutely lovely!
UNK:UNK This is more of a pizza joint for people who have young kids. They have kid games and it gets pretty noisy in here. The pizza is not too bad . If I was craving pizza, this place would not be high on my list but, it was an 'interesting' experience nonetheless. I suppose If I had kids or I was a kid I would probably enjoy coming here.
UNK:UNK Totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the 67 tv screens they have mounted on the walls.  Just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer. I ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products.   I would come back, but only if I didn't feel like driving all the way to Lucky Break in Tempe.
UNK:UNK Eh... pasta is way to salty.  Just just cause Mario B says cook your pasta in salt water, doesn't mean you have too and then dump salty sauce on top of it.  Tried to tell the manager but got blown off.  Just because you work for FRC doesn't mean you know what good food is.  Also, pizza greasy.
UNK:UNK Best cheese steaks since the last time i was in Philly. Highly recommended
UNK:UNK I don't know if it tastes like Chicago or not but it's reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed, so maybe it is like Chicago?  The atmosphere is cool I guess, but I'm a Bears fan so it's cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls.
UNK:UNK Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
UNK:UNK I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure. I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were. I appreciate all the time and help they gave me. The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are. AMAZING Dentists!!! My family has a new dentist. Thank you!!!
UNK:UNK Store is never stocked. Always out of stock on items. The Walmart on Bell Road is much better. Always has what I need - all the time.
UNK:UNK Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!
UNK:UNK Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here.
UNK:UNK I visited on high reviews.  I think it's a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger.
UNK:UNK Definitely going to make this a normal visit instead of waiting 3 years to try it.  Kool Aid in a Mason Jar was all I needed to see to know this was not going to be a typical dining experience and something to remember.  Food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the prices for the portions were more than fair.  Only the off beat location prevents me from making this a 5 star review.
UNK:UNK Decent wash, generally pretty quick. Used to be Octopus Car Wash. Has lube and detail center, although I have never used that service.   One of the better wash places- way better than Danny's for sure..
UNK:UNK This restaurant is close to my office, so we go for lunch at least once a month.  I love that it's bright, with great modern decor, and the seating is comfortable.  Service is always very good.  The prices and portions are a average for the area.  The cuisine is a twist on Sonoron, but nothing extraordinary.
UNK:UNK Great service and large portions.  I like it.  Nice, clean building too. I had the alfredo and it was tastey and was really like 2 meals beacuse I had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  A little pricey, but not too bad.
UNK:UNK Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees.
UNK:UNK Bomb ..................................................................................................................... Heated toilet seats
UNK:UNK My first time here. Service was fast and friendly. Had a HUGE slice of pepperoni to go. Really good, fresh, flavorful pizza. Love that I can get it by the slice!
UNK:UNK House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!
UNK:UNK I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time. They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant. I liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar. The food was really good and the staff rocked. I have been meaning to go back. I'll put that on my to-do list!
UNK:UNK These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun!!!! Quality instructors, will not disappoint!!! Lots of variety!!!
UNK:UNK Sadly, this Souper Salad has closed.     :-(
UNK:UNK I've been to Joe's & Bobby Q's but Dave's takes the BBQ on this one! We got Dave's family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And don't forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!
UNK:UNK As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.  Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.   AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.  It's the best hour of my week!  "
UNK:UNK I love this place. A little on the pricey side but the food is awesome and the staff is always cool.
UNK:UNK in addition to sucking, it's also expensive.
UNK:UNK I LOVE in n out burger, but this particular location kind of lacks.  I order a double double, mustard grilled, no onions with chopped chillies.  My burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale.
UNK:UNK In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump
UNK:UNK Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party
UNK:UNK These guys know their stuff.  Professional staff and great location.
UNK:UNK Wow! Some of the best barbecue in the state!! The pulled pork and the BBQ Baked Beans are a must try!!!
UNK:UNK This place is great.  All the food is fresh and always good.  They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend this place.
UNK:UNK Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!
UNK:UNK If your products weren't my number two love I would abandon you!!!  I only say this of this location!  One associate was SO snotty I wanted to punch her, and I'm not a violent individual!  Fashion Square receives my loyalty...
UNK:UNK We like this restaurant,  It is always good food and good service and convenient to our home.
UNK:UNK I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.
UNK:UNK Never had a bad meal or a bad beer here.  Great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and GOOD.  Great recipe for success.  Service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really (speculating here and actually giving the benefit of the doubt) don't care too much about customer service - it's just a job to them.
UNK:UNK We've eaten at this location quite a few times. We've always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my son's 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. We'll definately be having more parties here!
UNK:UNK Amazing.  Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went. Seriously. Try it.
UNK:UNK Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
UNK:UNK Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.
UNK:UNK Who doesn't love $3 well drinks? Relaxed, social, no frickin' paid seating!! Except that I was propositioned to " Swing" by some totally gross dude, I Lovd this place to start the evenings!!! Great cheap drinks.  What more do you need?
UNK:UNK Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demo'd for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car!  I am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here. Soon maybe... Hoping for a Sur Le Table Groupon!
UNK:UNK Love the convenience store. I stop every morning for a soda on my way to work.  They are friendly, efficient and clean.
UNK:UNK Pros... Quick, good, cooked right, self serve condiments, friendly staff. Good choice of size and type of meat. fresh buns, self serve drinks. Good Good Good.  Cons... The place is a little run down, they sometimes no self serve trash bins.
UNK:UNK I've only been the their location on Central Ave.  When I went to order my usual I was informed that this location doesn't have french fries.  Ok bummer... I'll get along with it.  We went later in the evening and the place was really dead.  I'm sure at lunchtime its much busier.
UNK:UNK I have been to the particular location many times.  Except for the wait, we have always had a good experience. I just love that deep dish pizza. I am sure it is on slice away from stopping my heart, but not here for the health food.
UNK:UNK If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles. A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable. A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out.  Yay!
UNK:UNK We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken were about a 3 star, but the chicken curry was really good and made up for the others. We also had the coconut water, which was fresh. Prices were reasonable we paid around $30.
UNK:UNK This place has the most AMAZING selection of cheeses. EVER. Boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and I was in heaven. Truly amazing variety and all were super yummy.
UNK:UNK Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.
UNK:UNK "They outta chicken or day just dont had none."
UNK:UNK The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.  Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "business closed".
UNK:UNK Just OK for lots of money. Service was very good, food was nothing special. Butter was rock solid, not spreadable. I would look for another seafood restaurant before ever going back to this one.
UNK:UNK I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
UNK:UNK Best pasta I have ever had. Don't go there if you're looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.
UNK:UNK Pleasant and beautiful. Feed the koi fish cheerios. Bathrooms are out of a catalog...I want that! Walk at a snail's pace, because it's not terribly large. When you're done, walk down to Pita Jungle or Lola Coffee!
UNK:UNK Typical chain "southwestern/Tex Mex" food in a corporatey atmosphere. They have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch, but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous.  Prices here are about on par with most places of this type (I put it in the Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Charleston's, etc.) category.   I enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the PV and Tempe locations.
UNK:UNK Inexpensive for the early bird special.  $5.55 for the combination plates that include egg roll, soup, rice, and your selection.  If the food only had more seasoning or flavor?  It was very bland and flavorless.  I usually do not use soy sauce, but needed to use it to add something to my dish.    Neat features: Koi pond inside with a bridge over it.
UNK:UNK Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.  It's. That. Good.
UNK:UNK Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good.
UNK:UNK The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!
UNK:UNK Best sushi in town.
UNK:UNK Unfortunately this UPS location is less than friendly or helpful.  Try the location near Fry's in Fountain Hills.  They are very friendly and helpful!!
UNK:UNK Food was marginal....Sunday brunch.  Prices were stupid.  And I felt like I  was in a New Orleans' night club...on Sunday morning.  Ick
UNK:UNK Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out.
UNK:UNK Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.
UNK:UNK This location is now closed.
UNK:UNK I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.
UNK:UNK Chef Bianco does it again! The homemade pasta is unreal. You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all. I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice. You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.
UNK:UNK Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?  Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?  and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.  *one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter  *minus the extra star for not having any matches
UNK:UNK Out of business
UNK:UNK This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!
UNK:UNK -1*  Dropped in for my 3rd visit & still no menu board or the other offerings that made them different....no cupcake, boba, etc.  Tried the pistachio fro yo & it had an artificial after taste.  Guess I'm driving back to Yogurtland for now.
UNK:UNK Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories).
UNK:UNK Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!
UNK:UNK I have been going to Niro's for several years.  You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality.  When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niro's to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint.  The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly.
UNK:UNK Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
UNK:UNK Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats. rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive . Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food. but weekdays pretty slow. If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.
UNK:UNK Possibly the creepiest convenience store I have ever been to.  I mean, it's sandwiched between a strip mall and a giant dirt lot.
UNK:UNK LOVE this place! I meet my husband here for lunch as often as I can. It is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good. I always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad. Excellent place to eat. The decor is funky but the staff is usually really nice and again, the food is great!
UNK:UNK Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done.
UNK:UNK Love, love, love this place! Great atmosphere, great for large groups, casual and fun! Have been here a number of times, and have yet to be let down. Order the sweet potato tater tots! Oh my goodness! Life changing!!!
UNK:UNK One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good.
UNK:UNK Good food when it's slow. Not so good when super busy. This is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the Harkins theater nearby. If the lot is full on a Friday or Sat night I would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed. Although the service there has always been pretty good for us, the food is hit and miss.
UNK:UNK Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago. But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far. =)
UNK:UNK Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
UNK:UNK So glad I decided to stop in today! Double stamp tuesday! Try the chai high! It is the perfect blend of tea and smoothie in one!!!!
UNK:UNK Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment.
UNK:UNK Good service and good food! I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them! A quick little meal for those on the go! The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting.
UNK:UNK I've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.
UNK:UNK Not long ago I went and got takeout - and everything tasted kind of fishy.
UNK:UNK Barb at Tees and More does a great job.  They provided our company shirts and did a perfect job.  Fast service, great service and great people.
UNK:UNK I stopped in on my lunch break.  The BBQ isn't bad for a fast food type of place.  I had the brisket on this particular visit.  The BBQ sauces weren't the best I've had.  If you are in the area and looking for BBQ, I recommend Pork on a Fork.
UNK:UNK This restaurant is close to my office, so it is a regular stop for either a great Mexican breakfast or lunch. Never been dissapointed, nor have any of my co workers. Try the Huevos Rancheros or the Chiliquiles ( With the Green Sauce ), it is a favorite.
UNK:UNK I've been there twice. Only a girl serve the table. If there are too many people,you have to wait for a long time.   We ordered the tofu soup. That was great. Others, just that taste. Not good not bad.
UNK:UNK This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. I've donated blood at this location 10+ times and have never had to wait. Of course, I can't encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often.
UNK:UNK It's not only a book store but also a community wherein a lot of readers meet. They also have a wide selection of used and unused books as well as novelty items so I get to do my shopping at the same time!
UNK:UNK I remember this place being good the few times I went there. I had a chicken salad sandwich one time that was awesome. I miss it.
UNK:UNK C'mon! Fresh sandwich lunch for $3? The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches. Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee. Or is it no fee? Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas. Line moves super fast. Number pickup system is funky. My family packs these things to take home on the plane!
UNK:UNK Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices
UNK:UNK This place was highly recommended by various websites, so I gave it a shot when I was in Scottsdale. The service was great and the food was good.   We sat in the bar area which was lively. It feels like a neighborhood hangout, so everyone looked like they were friends and having a good time.
UNK:UNK Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    I'm not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake.
UNK:UNK Lacking a clean or acceptable Chinese restaurant in Casa Grande, I discovered this jewel while showing homes in Anthem. Menu has many choices and restaurant is clean with attractive decor. The dishes I have chosen so far have been excellent with nice portions. Service is friendly and efficient. Well worth the drive from anywhere in Pinal County!!!
UNK:UNK I like Buffalo. They always buy my stuff, and I like looking around at what they have.    I think the reason a lot of people don't like this place is because they try to sell ugly nasty shit that no one wants to wear. It's a recession, so, you're not going to get top dollar for your J Crew tee shirts that you bought 4 years ago that have pit stains and are hideous. Duh.
UNK:UNK This is hands down the best place for bagels... but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever. I just wish they would open on in Greenville. Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese... I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale... .n
UNK:UNK Hmm...this place has a good lunch happy hour, but the choices in the menu are kindof limited.  The food isn't bad, but it's not amazing.  So, three stars for being average i guess?  I do come back every so often so I guess it's a plus.
UNK:UNK Great food, great atmosphere.  Look for the grafetti out back.  Not "Mexican food," but Mexico City cuisine.
UNK:UNK The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru. I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.
UNK:UNK I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..
UNK:UNK Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
UNK:UNK Extremely slow service, hostess and manager were both rude. I noticed that 2 tables that sat after we did got served first.   4 out of every 10 people that walked in, walked right back out once they saw the line.   We waited 35 minutes for a table. This was my first and last time at this over priced Denny's
UNK:UNK Not much to say about Lola's. Its cute. Its quaint. And the food it utterly delish and authentic. Oh, but bring a sweater....they  usually have the air on "Polar Bear"!  The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 is b/c of  the freezing temp and the community seating. Doesn't bother me....well, maybe just a little. Can be a bit noisy and bad for private conversation.  Bon Appetite!
UNK:UNK sslowest drive through ever!!!
UNK:UNK I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!  There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.  Treat yourself.  You will be happy you did.
UNK:UNK This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, I've never eaten there.  They have PBR there.   Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but it's not a place I spend a lot of time.
UNK:UNK This location is a glorified garage sale. It smells and nobody speaks English. Children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people.   If you are lucky, you can find shoes, but I have never found jack shit for clothes.  Go upstairs to Marshall's and spare yourself.
UNK:UNK This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2  Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.
UNK:UNK I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.
UNK:UNK My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly.  Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!
UNK:UNK Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well...   Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.
UNK:UNK I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o. The sandwich ... Fave.. I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting
UNK:UNK This place is great!
UNK:UNK We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven.  The drive was worth it.  Loved everything about this place from the service to the food! Definitely be back.
UNK:UNK This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!
UNK:UNK Wow these cupcakes were amazing!! The frosting was picture-perfect. I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good! The cake on both were super dense and moist. Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two!
UNK:UNK i was really unimpressed with the pizza here. it's conveninetly located, but never very busy, even at it's prime location by a bar even on a friday night. cheap slices, and easy to get in and out of, but of all the many, many people i know who frequent this area, none of them really ever eat there.
UNK:UNK Glad to say this place is still going strong a little over a year after my first visit/review. Wanna try it? Then visit on a Tuesday night for $1 tacos and $2 cervezas! They have amazingly good Tacos and Salsa, and an excellent Tequila bar. Do try the grilled corn on the cob.  Excellent place to hang all night with friends - great drinks, great food, great prices.
UNK:UNK this is not in the mall dq a real road side flash back
UNK:UNK It's the kinda place where you're certain the employees don't spit in your food.  Best Taco Bell I've been to.
UNK:UNK The service we had was good, food was alright, the prices seemed high.  Just a sports bar.    Fine never going to again.
UNK:UNK As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like "wha? really? is this IRL?"   I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.
UNK:UNK If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome...
UNK:UNK I LOVE White Lion Tea. The company uses great quality of everything!!! My favorites are Tuscany, Ginger Peach, Green Passion Tea, White Ambrosia Tea as far as I have tried :)  Everytime I opened a tea bag, I have to take a good deep inhale from a tea bag. It's smell soooo great as the tea taste. Thank you White Lion for having such awesome products !!!
UNK:UNK The new Kale salad is to die for!  I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!
UNK:UNK The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.  I really don't have to say anymore.
UNK:UNK Stopped in for some macaroons and coffee, the food and coffee were decent. The place itself was kinda dirty, stains on the floor, saw a couple of flies, and sat in an uneven chair.
UNK:UNK Great multigrain sandwiches. Nice patio too!
UNK:UNK I'm always perplexed when the staff knows nothing about their on-line specials. This time it was the Yelp ad. Luckily it was quickly resolved by the bartender this time which was refreshing.   The place it's self is a pretty generic bar. I just had a few drinks along with the Crab Cakes which were actually pretty good.
UNK:UNK little known secret- the golf course bar!!!!  amazing margaritas and a super-cheap happy hour.  didn't mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing, either!  my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa.
UNK:UNK I consider myself fortunate enough to have had a business lunch here a few weeks back. The food was excellent. Steak and potatoes just what a man wants! It was very well done and finished with a 3 berry cheesecake. Worth the moolah!
UNK:UNK Consistently a good experience.  Not a fancy place by any means but a great neighborhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food.
UNK:UNK I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again.
UNK:UNK Uninspired. From the food to the staff, just another mediocre Chinese restaurant in the valley. I expected something better.
UNK:UNK Met a few friends here for happy hour.  They had $5 martinis, but that's not what I ended up getting.  They have a drink special everyday.  That day they had the Walter Crankite, I think!  It was like an appletini with cranberry juice.  We didn't order anything else.  The service was great.  Our servere was very attentive.
UNK:UNK Seriously the most pathetic burger I've had.... ever? On the level of a Burger king or the like. With tip I paid $15 for the burger and fries. What a waste - and they even managed to get the order wrong. A buffalo burger that had no buffalo sauce on it. When I told the waiter he made up for it by bringing a little cup of sauce. Oi... pathetic.
UNK:UNK Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere. Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money. The amazing reclining seats are worth it though. I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies!     Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!
UNK:UNK In the mood for a little snack? this is the place. Don't remember what I ordered (my indian friend helped me), but it was good! and also try desserts!!
UNK:UNK This place is home.
UNK:UNK Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!
UNK:UNK Expensive for having grown their own food. Good product and fresh
UNK:UNK This place has had awesome bread since day one. Whatever else you walk out with is just a bonus. Actually, I have to say that the produce selection is getting noticeably better each time I walk in. I still don't think it's quite suitable for everyday shopping, but it's coming along pretty well.
UNK:UNK Yum! Healthy selections and delicious flavors!
UNK:UNK I really don't know how to rate Lolo's, because, frankly, this place killed me.  It was only temporary, but I was definitely dead, heart stopped, for a solid five or six seconds.    Lolo's is serious eats.  So good, it was just painful.  Literally.  I really don't think I can return anytime soon.  I know it's for the best.  I'm nowhere near joking.
UNK:UNK Very authentic and very good Vietnamese food. Great value for the money and clearly a favorite with the local Vietnamese.  The spring rolls were very tasty and came with a terrific peanut sauce.  They also provide many other typical condiments on the table to spice up your dish.  I had the slice beef Pho and it was delicious!  I'll be back.
UNK:UNK Like many car washes they do what it takes to scrape by.  I am still looking for a place that actually puts a little extra elbow grease into it.  I am tired of being upsold on exterior waxes etc and they cant even take the time to vacuum my seats.
UNK:UNK They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.
UNK:UNK Love the veggie rolls ! Also, the saki bombs are quite bomb =)
UNK:UNK Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.
UNK:UNK Good Whole Foods location overall... The workers are very nice and attentive, and the food selection is good! Not the biggest Whole Foods I've ever been to, though.
UNK:UNK Still a fan. I'm incredibly impressed one of the staff even remembered my name and my last purchase on a return visit.
UNK:UNK Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around. The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start! I also like their orange beef! Definitely worth to eat for!
UNK:UNK Decent food at a good price. Bargain lunch specials in a good atmosphere.
UNK:UNK Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!  If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour.
UNK:UNK For vegan fare, it's passable. I liked the food, but not totally in love with it. The teas were the best though, and didn't have any dessert but it sounded amazing.
UNK:UNK Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so it's just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly.
UNK:UNK When I found out that they do banquets here, I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The service was as good as it gets...period.  The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful, and the result was beyond fantastic!  From the appetizers, to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert...this place rocks.
UNK:UNK Fun Fun Fun!  If you're looking for some fun for your kids or you just need to get out some stress yourself, come here.  Enjoy the adrenaline release you can get by shooting at other people in a dark maze with your laser gun while trying not to get shot yourself. This place is great. :)
UNK:UNK i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.  she's very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.  she is reasonably priced.
UNK:UNK This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.  They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.  She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.
UNK:UNK This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost. It's fast, convenient, clean & friendly! You choose the style of fitness YOU want, and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU. And you will see your progress after each session. AWESOME!!! I like it so much I'm going 6 days a week!
UNK:UNK This place is pretty good. better than average but not great. Fish fry on Fridays is ok if you like DEEP battered fish. nice atmosphere lots of TV's. Uquiel Beer on Tap
UNK:UNK If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!
UNK:UNK Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most
UNK:UNK Authentic mouth watering food. Got the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied.
UNK:UNK I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was. Delicious food.
UNK:UNK Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
UNK:UNK This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isn't done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late.
UNK:UNK I've always had a pleasant experience at Mojo in Tempe Marketplace. I have been to this location about 4 times and they always provide good quality and value. My favorite is the red velvet froyo.
UNK:UNK We really liked this place. I got the grande burrito with zuchinni & peppers i it which was really good. Loved their carne asada and the prices were great. I wish they ha more on their dessert menu. Would love home made churros! Staff was friendly. Would for sure go here again. Much better than baja fresh, rubios, tace bell & most other mexican places around PHX that we've been to.
UNK:UNK One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio.
UNK:UNK This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.
UNK:UNK 4 1/2 stars - really great place!  The decor is nice with cool artwork and beautiful flowers on every table, the service is friendly and food is authentic and delicious!  There happy hour specials are pretty good as well!
UNK:UNK The food is good, but took a while to get to us.
UNK:UNK Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!
UNK:UNK The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.
UNK:UNK What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes.
UNK:UNK Steak cooked to perfection.
UNK:UNK Good:  22 courts, backboards, big pro shop, cold beverages, ice cream, nice clean bathrooms, nice people work there.  Bad: Pro shop seems to only carry women's clothes and old old school mens cloths, the lights are the second worse in the valley (after Indian School Park)  I have never paid for courts because I play on a league so I dont know about the rates.  The courts were clean and well kept.
UNK:UNK The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!
UNK:UNK Julio G's lunch menu offers some very delightful dishes.  I recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans. The wait staff was very nice and efficient.  Good group restaurant spot!
UNK:UNK The burger I had there was tasteless and had a weird texture. The fries were decent and their signature Rootbeer was delicious, but I've definitely had better elsewhere.  In all fairness, I did not try their frozen selection, so I will definitely come back to give them another try.
UNK:UNK I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff.
UNK:UNK Jon, Tess, Charlie, Erin, Kathleen and whole gang are the best!!!
UNK:UNK Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+!  The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again.
UNK:UNK I had been wanting to try Sal's for quite a while but never got around to it.  Until today!  I got a side salad and the 14" Sal's Favorite.  I must say, not impressed at all.  The salad was made of what looked like a bag of pre-shredded lettuce.  And not very fresh either.  The pizza was just ok, I've had much better.  Very sad and disappointed, unfortunately I will not be going back to Sal's.
UNK:UNK Cool hotel bar in a cool hotel.  Get a booth and enjoy the crowd.  Be sure to get a cocktail or four at the hotel lobby bar before dinner during happy hour.  Cool place and glad we checked this place out.
UNK:UNK 4.5 Stars The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.
UNK:UNK This place looks sleek from the causeway, but the food is marginal. We had the veggie taco plate and the veggie burrito. Both lacked flavor, even the "spicy" salsa was bland. Server was friend and attentive, that is the only reason I am giving it two stars. I would just go here for a drink next time and skip the food entirely.
UNK:UNK Definitely an awesome buffet.  Not your typical buffet stereotype.  Love the sushi.   Great variety of things to have.  If memory serves,  it was 19.99 when I was there.  I think a tad high, but someone mentioned 25 bucks, so maybe it's come down :-?  Sake is priced well, and the beers.
UNK:UNK There are two places in Phoenix that have the BEST barbecue sauce.  Honey Bears is the "Not sweet" one, LoveJoys is the "Sweet" one.  Love them both.
UNK:UNK Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.  Quality cut and great people. These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.  No froo froo!  Russian not spoken there!
UNK:UNK Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge.
UNK:UNK Amazing food and I prefer the atmosphere at this location.
UNK:UNK Awesome job rejuvenating this bar from the dark dive bar it was. They have a great selection of brews from all over AZ, the US, and the globe as well as a very decent wine list. Thus far I've tried the pork tacos and the grilled cheese, both of which were delicious. Service was a little on the slow side as our server was clearly over-loaded.
UNK:UNK Step back in time! Every once in awhile you start to look for something different for lunch and then pops up a place like MacAlpines. Besides the great 50's atmosphere and good food, this place will have you smiling and reminicing the moment you step into the door!  I am not downtown that often but rest assured, I will be back to this place.
UNK:UNK My birthday cake came from Tammie Coe and it was AMAZING.   It was beautiful decorated with amazing frosting. But it was the inside that won me over. Gooey, decadent chocolate, oh my! It was so rich, I ate half a slice... but it was oh so worth it!
UNK:UNK Been dining here about a year and still trying diff things from the menu and all have been good. I don't think the heat is unedible even the hottest plates are just "good" hot.
UNK:UNK Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.  They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.  I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime.   Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!
UNK:UNK Who the heck doesn't love huge amounts of toilet paper and free samples of food... come on now!
UNK:UNK Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome. Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet. If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it.
UNK:UNK This is the second time we visited India Gate. The service was as good as the last time we were there. The waiters are attentive and friendly, willing to explain in detail what and how each dishes were made (for those of us who has no idea what some of the items are on the menu)  Cozy place to have a nice meal, reasonable price.
UNK:UNK I just love this place and  I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  Highly recommend any of their spa treatments.
UNK:UNK These donuts don't taste good anymore. They have an aftertaste like they are using a different type of oil
UNK:UNK Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend. I don't mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.
UNK:UNK Love this studio! Teachers are nice and accomodating. This is possibly one of the best yoga classes I have studied. This is a place where you sweat your ass off while listening to music and meditating. Love Sumits Yoga and love the studio in Chandler. Best part is the practice is expanding so check out the website. www.sumitsyoga.com
UNK:UNK Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.  Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.
UNK:UNK I had lunch at Lon's and wow, what a great experience.  Great food, great service and great ambiance outside.  I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly.  Maybe he was having a bad day?  His unfriendliness aside, this is a must try if you are  in the area.
UNK:UNK Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa.
UNK:UNK I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.  I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo I've had!  On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.  They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.  Check it out!
UNK:UNK will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back.
UNK:UNK This is a good store for your beauty needs. They are open until 8pm too which is nice.
UNK:UNK Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. They've got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and it's not messy.  Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries.
UNK:UNK Healing hands!  A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of "spot on" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!   To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!!
UNK:UNK I go there often. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Great beers & usually great service
UNK:UNK Sushi is absolutely nothing to write home about. They have happy hour all day everyday, which is a great way to start your night. The Korean pork tacos are bomb! Great location in Old Town Snottsdale. Love the staff and atmosphere!
UNK:UNK The date shake is like "the best vanilla shake ever" with little tiny pieces of chopped up dates coming up through the straw the whole time.  Awesome.
UNK:UNK We went early, so we didn't have any of the seating issues others have mentioned.  The decor and set-up was neat, and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  I agree that the drinks are pretty expensive -- but the White Rabbit was amazing.  I'm not  a big fan of mixed drinks generally, but horchata and white chocolate liqueur?  Awesome!  I'll definitely be back.  Great place!
UNK:UNK I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.
UNK:UNK Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!
UNK:UNK Patio seating is lovely!
UNK:UNK I love Stax. They introduced me to the world of quinoa. Their quinoa black bean burger is sensational. I do the "Build your own burger" and get garlic aioli and the house ketchup. I am a big fan of their sweet potato fries, as well.  The service has always been great and the prices are reasonable. This is a good alternative to Delux, if you are in downtown Scottsdale.
UNK:UNK Decent farmers market with several friendly vendors.  Look for the jalopeno peanut brittle, the incredible maccaroons, sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness! lots of yumminess and it is dog-friendly!
UNK:UNK I had the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  It was a solid sandwich overall.  The quality of ingredients was pretty good, but the only part that gets me is the price. $8 + tax?  Wow all that "supply and demand" stuff I learned in Econ class wasn't a joke.  Worth trying once, but I don't think this is a place I'll be grabbing lunch at on a regular basis.
UNK:UNK Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating "regular" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!
UNK:UNK Parents, please let ur children explore on their own!  I c parents following their kids around !
UNK:UNK It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following. Made a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours. Staff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean.
UNK:UNK Great sushi, not so great on speed. Cute place, friendly staff. Try the Vegie Goyza, it is great. Sushi rolls are a bit large for one bite. Asked if we wanted a Tea refill as we were leaving. Huh?
UNK:UNK With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry. The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.
UNK:UNK Yummy food!!!! Period!!! Sandwiches are great!!! Customer service is great!!! I was at the counter while ordering, i was asking about the cake, they had on display and the guy gave me a free slice o cake cuz it was my first time there!!  cool place, good food.
UNK:UNK Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
UNK:UNK Everything I have tried here is awesome! You can't go wrong with your choices! Service is ok. Could be better. Not very personable!
UNK:UNK I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too.
UNK:UNK Wow, I am surprised at the last review.  I have found the food at Bada Boom Pasta Room to be excellent every time I have been there.  I am in love with Mr. Pink's Pasta. It has a delightful vodka sauce, and you can also add proscuitto wrapped shrimp as well. They have a fantastic martini selection a well, and the decor it hip and fun.  Did anyone say red velvet walls?  Great place!
UNK:UNK I'm a Sprint customer so maybe I'm biased. I'll just say that upfront.  I got another phone on my plan and had no problems. At all.  Once I told the salesperson that I lost my connection cable for my BB 8330, he gave me one free.  Score.  Though, minus one star for not being a repair store.
UNK:UNK Top notch. He is now my go to barber. Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut. He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for. Can't go wrong with this guy. And what a cool place!
UNK:UNK I told myself not to buy clothes at Macy's since I did not have that much room in my carry-on luggage. Darn you Macy's!! Why did you have a bazillion racks of clothes that was on sale!!! NooOOo.. I could not resist the temptation and bought 4 shirts for $60. I wanted to buy more too!!   I have a love-hate relationship with this Macy's.
UNK:UNK This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos "Lunch With Stew". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar.
UNK:UNK Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!
UNK:UNK ok experience, just got to a point I did not want my membership anymore and it was complicated to stop it all. I just did not like the autopay committment.
UNK:UNK As far as malls go - and I hate malls - this one is tolerable. Just speed past the food court to avoid a cluster you-know-what.   If you like upscale, this is your place. Me, I typically hit two to three stores and leave. But maybe that's just my shopping style.  If you have the cash to blow, the time to spend and the desire to shop, then this is your mall.
UNK:UNK OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but it's well worth it.
UNK:UNK Very excited to try this place out.  I tried the sampler of all 4 beers and really enjoyed them all; however, the watermelon ale was my favorite.  Great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer = a winner!
UNK:UNK I love every place on South Mountain. I've been wanting to try a Monte Cristo for awhile now. The wait was well worth it. Massive flavor explosion in the mouth. Finished it off, chased it with fresh lemonade, and seriously wanted to order round two. For sure will be back next week for that second one.
UNK:UNK I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.
UNK:UNK This place makes some of the best vegan gelato/ice cream I've had. If you're vegan, skip the (kinda gross) soy froyo, and eat one of the gelatos. The service was super friendly and all the gelatos were super tasty. I had a big scoop of peanut butter soy gelato. It was by far the best peanut butter based ice cream I've ever had.
UNK:UNK Very nice theater, with a very friendly staff.  The seats were comfortable, the popcorn was fresh, and the place was clean.
UNK:UNK Busy place, but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination. They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early...
UNK:UNK Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal.
UNK:UNK We love Dr Steve!
UNK:UNK This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch.
UNK:UNK Yum! Delicious tasting pizza, a wonderful atmosphere, and oh those  Nutella crepes are devine!
UNK:UNK This is in a really cute part of Chandler.  I've driven by a million times, but never paid attention to the all the restaurants.  We went here for lunch based on the great reviews it received on Yelp.    I can't really add much more to the other reviews, but just wanted to be one more person to say that the food is delicious & service was excellent.  Great ambiance & music too!
UNK:UNK The french toast was delicious! Toddy was especially good
UNK:UNK A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.
UNK:UNK I love the Starbucks in the Safeway here. Marissa...the girl who is normally the barista...is so nice!
UNK:UNK This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment.
UNK:UNK I haven't been in a while but I remember being impressed.  Nice ambiance, especially for a Thai restaurant.
UNK:UNK This hotel is amazing! The staff is very friendly, it's very  clean and it has wide space for a hotel room, nice swimming pool with a heated pool. They have free breakfast and free dinner:) and it's pretty much near with everything you need: mall, restaurants and bars:)
UNK:UNK Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.  And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.
UNK:UNK Just recently drove by this Target. It was one of my favorites. Now it's closed!
UNK:UNK Yumm!  Thai tea, spicy Thai beef salad, number 23a and a 32, all of it was delicious! I recommend this place. Just don't go in a hurry because you will be there a while
UNK:UNK The Breakfast Club is as good as you'll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty.
UNK:UNK Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!
UNK:UNK Appears to be CLOSED.  Phone number not in service. Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building.
UNK:UNK Dr. Ken Danyluk and his team offer an Extraordinary Orthodontic experience.  Team Orthodonitcs offers many Orthodontic soluitions for all ages.  Whether patients choose traditional braces, Invisalign or "Hidden Brace" lingual braces behind their teeth, they always leave happy!
UNK:UNK Probably the best mall I've ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macy's, Dillards and Barneys New York. It's so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it.  My wife called it the best mall she's ever been too. Nuff said.
UNK:UNK Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe I'm just getting old.  The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place I've been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in.
UNK:UNK I couldn't agree with David more.  The owner is definitley an interesting  person.  The more money she thinks you make, the more she will talk to and love you!  So tell her you are RICH!! (Sorry Didi C.) As for the food -  Ho hum VN food at high for what you get prices.  The Pho is very avg and double the usual price. They don't charge a corkage fee for  BYOB which is nice.
UNK:UNK This place is perfect! Great food, great service and friendly people. We will be back over and over again! We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent (Stetson chopped salad, scallops, testosterone salad). Lovvvve it!
UNK:UNK Love it! Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.
UNK:UNK Love this place !  Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy.  it is a great little find.
UNK:UNK Pool supplies next to Quiznos Subs!
UNK:UNK A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa.   They have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot.   Wish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.
UNK:UNK Pho-k yeah .......and the spring rolls too ........
UNK:UNK Tonight at Noca Phoenix No dinner -waited 1.5 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very  disappointing
UNK:UNK I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...  Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.    If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.  P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!
UNK:UNK Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
UNK:UNK went here for breakfast with some friends. it was pretty busy and only had to wait maybe 10-15 mins to be seated. not too bad. quick service, we had coffee almost immediately.   the food was delicious. standard breakfast food in my opinion. i got the corn beef hash meal. everything was good, and cooked the way i like. i would definitely come back here if i was in the area!
UNK:UNK We had a great lunch and enjoyed our visit tremendously. Of special note though was the help I got from one of the guys on giving me some directions to Florance via the "adventure  route", It was very nice of him to spend this time with me. Thanks for the great service. If you vist juisit make sure to take time on the patio and enjoy
UNK:UNK Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).  The concept of this place is killer.
UNK:UNK Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa
UNK:UNK Good, quick option in downtown phoenix. We dined here before a Suns game and we got in and out with great service and delicious food in under 45 minutes. The Pho was very good, as was the noodle dish I ordered.
UNK:UNK Food is good. Don't take kids though. Kids pasta was $7 with no accompaniments.
UNK:UNK Excellent place for a nice dinner, A classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food
UNK:UNK Decent upscale place in Tempe.  Great ambiance outdoors on the patio.  Service is very sketchy...sometime good, sometimes bad, never great.
UNK:UNK Went for lunch. Took over 30 min for food to arrive. Ordered chef salad. Made with processed turkey and ham. Also with processed cheese slices. childs choc milk was not mixed up. Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu.  Won't come back again.
UNK:UNK This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
UNK:UNK My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.
UNK:UNK Great new multi-purpose entertainment facility that just opened. They just started serving food last night and I had a fabulous "Punk Panini" sandwich ... value for the price....and a rock band going last night..... Can't wait for the theater to open and the bar to begin serving in the next couple of weeks.....
UNK:UNK Yummy yum ! I ordered the little cheeseburger and cajun fries....It was really well done...I luved it and will go back soon...someday when the craving for burgers and fries strikes again !!
UNK:UNK Love this store!
UNK:UNK The best fried chicken I have ever had pork cutlet is not to be missed either the collard greens flavor is unbelievable and purely vegetarian broth if you can belive that - absolutely no sourness  I regular have to make pilgrimages for my pregnant wife here.  Negative - cash only
UNK:UNK Decaf coffee was the best thing going here. Big cup, super hot and tasty.    White flannel hash was a miss. For me the flavors were off. Too much salt and way too much garlic, for my taste. Service was polite but a bit slow for how empty it was. If you like garlic and a heavy hand with salt, this might be your place.
UNK:UNK The service was slow, the server knew nothing of the wines on the menu and knew nothing of proper wine service.  Boo.
UNK:UNK I'm not a fan of Thai food or buffets but this place is great. Food is great and it very decently priced! It's not super busy, so the food isn't always "fresh out of the kitchen" tasting, but I really enjoy the Pink Pepper!
UNK:UNK Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy.
UNK:UNK Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good
UNK:UNK Sandwiches are very above average in taste, but they are on the spendy side.
UNK:UNK Great beer, really good food and no wait. Ok yes it was noon on a Sat but that can be hard to find any day of the week, at any time.
UNK:UNK Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming-  Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners
UNK:UNK My daughter treated me to a facial here for my birthday. It was lovely and included a massage of my feet and hands. The student was very professional. It normally costs $33 for the signature facial, but was only $25 for my trip since they were running a back to school special for the month of August.
UNK:UNK We ordered seabass and ribs. Both excellent choices. Service very good. Ambiance was unexpected. Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees. Used restaurant.com coupon. Great deal.
UNK:UNK Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.
UNK:UNK super great neighborhood bookstore. it's local and not owned by the man. jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.  They have new and used book and something is always on sale. It's attached to wild flower and next to macs.
UNK:UNK I eat there about 3 times a week!! The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can't be beat!
UNK:UNK I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.
UNK:UNK Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend. Would definitely recommend!
UNK:UNK Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!
UNK:UNK I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in, no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic.
UNK:UNK Friendly staff and great Americanos!
UNK:UNK Glorified Pei Wei
UNK:UNK Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants.
UNK:UNK I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad. The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese. The salad was terrible!
UNK:UNK Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.
UNK:UNK Great place, great food, great environment .
UNK:UNK I'm tired of trekking to the east valley for Lee's Sandwiches.  Thao's hit the spot. The marinade for their grilled pork is excellent, very flavorful. I was surprised to see that they are a full service restaurant, offering pho and a variety of plated meals too.
UNK:UNK Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.   The regular size doesn't look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.   A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo.
UNK:UNK Nice little wine bar.  I enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch.  Pretty tasty.  The food won't win any culinary rewards, but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh. Minor niggle, they only seem to have high-top seating... when all I want to do is curl up in a booth and drink myself silly, this can be a problem.
UNK:UNK I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch! The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.  Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated! Go to this branch, you'll understand what I mean!
UNK:UNK Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!
UNK:UNK Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable.
UNK:UNK Great tire shop. I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat. Very nice people, and very fair prices.
UNK:UNK Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day.
UNK:UNK VERY nice. The owner supports soldiers; we used a USO voucher here for a quick last-minute getaway before my husband deployed. The rooms are very clean and seem really updated. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and the breakfast is pretty good. It's also RIGHT next to Ikea, can't go wrong there!
UNK:UNK I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!
UNK:UNK If you need fake nunchuks, old china, random golf clubs, and a great selection of clothes to sort through, then this is your savers.
UNK:UNK AZ 88 was a great experience all around. It's a fun, hip and hopping place. They have an excellent bar selection, and although all I can only personally speak for is the to-die-for burgundy burger, there were four us and everyone was raving about their meals.
UNK:UNK I go there once a month or so with friends.  Yeh, people watching is the best.  I like to dance too, and I don't care if people think I'm horrible.  I'm usually laughing and having fun.  And that's the point, right?    When you get tired of one room, go to the other.  It's fun.
UNK:UNK Good pizza, nice place & the owner was very accommodating. I'm a fan.
UNK:UNK we come here about once a week. the soup in a bread bowl is yummy- i usually get a wildflower salad with the pesto vinegarette, which is amazing! their grain mustard is also amazing and the service is usually very good. the clientele can be interesting so it is a good place to people watch :)
UNK:UNK Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten. I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+
UNK:UNK Don't get Breonna as your server. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didn't appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always.
UNK:UNK Sketchy name indeed, but their grilled chicken pita sandwich is the bomb! It was filled to the brim with saucy, tasty goodness. I still think about that damn sandwich. I need to go back soon!  Interior was a bit lacking, service was OK, but the food is sooo worth it. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu.
UNK:UNK Everything here just seemed so very dry to me.  Like it was mass prepared a few days ago and they reheat it, put sauce on it and serve it.  The sushi felt the same way somehow.
UNK:UNK Clean, modern hotel with spacious suites including decent sized refrigerators (easily accommodates a 30 pack).  Staff was fantastic and went out of there way to work around hiccups. Local shuttle, free breakfast, managers reception in the evenings; and all within walking distance of Scottsdale Stadium.
UNK:UNK I can only comment on two of the smoothies because I am on a banana kick and I choose from one of the two: the Bananrama or the Peanut Butter Chocolate. Oh so good! And now they do offer more than one size!  I have started getting this for dinner versus food! I love it!
UNK:UNK Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
UNK:UNK Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off.
UNK:UNK Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice.
UNK:UNK This place has consistently good food on EVERY visit. Lots of choices and really fast service! Lucky to have this so close to work. Check the soup and sandwich combo. Salad bar rocks too.
UNK:UNK i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.  Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.  We always have fun just eating at the bar.  Yumm
UNK:UNK This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.
UNK:UNK Even though there are only two things on the menu that I can eat, they're damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast.  I am a bit surprised by all the five stars though, you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint, right?
UNK:UNK Had to bring my wife's necklace here to be repaired. Service was great, the pretty looking girls were very helpful. In all, we had a very good experience. Looks like we will be coming back soon. Wife had her eyes on something?
UNK:UNK Love spicy Mexican food? Well then this is the place for you. They have great food, great service and great beers to choose from. My family and I go here often.
UNK:UNK Great Crust. Great ingredients.  Worth the hype of Peter Reinhart's book American Pie?   Not sure.   It was great though.  No fresh ice tea kepts it from getting 5/5.
UNK:UNK Best prices in Phoenix nice ladies,   will do exactly what you ask with your hair
UNK:UNK i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!
UNK:UNK The owner is extremly friendly. Great place as all the other Yelpers have said. I ordered the Blackened chicken sandwich with patato salad. Not too spicy, but just right. The patato salad was extremly good. If your out and about in the afternoon looking for lunch, stop in here.
UNK:UNK I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal.
UNK:UNK A classic hole in the wall mexican restaurant and a Phoenix icon. Known best for their machaca and their hot, freshly made flour tortillas. Good food at great prices.  For a photo of the best chimichanga in Phoenix and a full review, check out my blog post: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/carolinas
UNK:UNK Mail Call is a full service shipping store. The owners are great-they are friendly and accommodating. I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair, much less than a larger place up in the airpark. They take care all of my local needs and get the job done. Kudos to Mail Call!
UNK:UNK I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception! Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned. The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good. Far superior to the Char's Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location.
UNK:UNK Fabulous place to get wine, beer, spirits.  It also has amazing keg selection.
UNK:UNK Best bruschetta I have had here. Good wine selection as well.  My favorite bruschetta are: -smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil -roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese -pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper -mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic
UNK:UNK If you want Cheap go to Walmart!   But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!
UNK:UNK Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.  I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding.   Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews.
UNK:UNK Huge Fan of this place. People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service. Huge fan of the sandwiches.
UNK:UNK My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!
UNK:UNK Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!
UNK:UNK Great place to grab some quick groceries.
UNK:UNK Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
UNK:UNK .:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:. It's got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect.   The custard is great .:lick:. and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.(They have no sugar added custard). i would definitely recommend this place! .:lick:.
UNK:UNK Solid place to grab a cup of coffee and a morning pastry.  Not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place.  I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito too and it was very tasty albeit a bit pricey in my opinion.  Check this place out if you're in the area for breakfast.
UNK:UNK Very good, cheap Chinese food. Lots of specials including beer.   The only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons' tables. If this is a regular occurrence, get the food to go.
UNK:UNK By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal "taco shop", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum.
UNK:UNK This is an awesomely fun place about an hour and a half south east of Phoenix. Although they are making their own wine yet they have some "private label" wines and a great selection of other wines and beers available. The staff is awesome and the ambience is very cool. You can "lose" a day here just hanging out and enjoying it!
UNK:UNK Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.
UNK:UNK Not quite hot sex on a platter but good food, yummy beer and great music go a long way!
UNK:UNK Great place for cheap drinks!  Everybody knows each other and you can becom part of the Playa family quick :) Sharen ( the owner ) is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit.  Great place to watch games !
UNK:UNK Best noodles in Phoenix. This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix. PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot. Its also excellent for leftovers too.
UNK:UNK Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area.  You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good (we go here about once a week).  Favorites:  Hummus and Gyro Delux!  Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)
UNK:UNK Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine! I walked out feeling like a  Super Model without spending a fortune! Great Stylists. Upbeat Friendly  atmosphere. Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE!  Convenient Parking  and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy. LOVE it!
UNK:UNK My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon!   Keep it up!
UNK:UNK Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza It's the only thing I've ever ordered there And it alone warrants 5 stars.
UNK:UNK Been going to Bailey's for the last six months. It's an older crowd during the day, but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger! Bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap, though they could be stronger. I highly recommend it!
UNK:UNK Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!
UNK:UNK My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.  I highly recommend it.
UNK:UNK Experienced happy hour for the first time.  Amazing food and drink for cheap prices.  Only downer the bar tender.  It was a pasted on smile.  I will return and take people with me.
UNK:UNK Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want
UNK:UNK Like earning cheaper gas
UNK:UNK The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people. I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.
UNK:UNK I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.
UNK:UNK Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.
UNK:UNK I've never had Thai food before so I suppose I have nothing to compare it to, but this restaurant didn't serve very tasty food. Maybe it was just what I ordered. I don't know. Plus it had a funny smell. It wasn't terrible but I'm not going back.
UNK:UNK Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.
UNK:UNK This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels.
UNK:UNK Great atmosphere! Awesome drink specials :)
UNK:UNK Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too.  Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop.  Bring cash, not credit or debit cards
UNK:UNK I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I can't say enough good about them, so I won't ramble.... Just love them.
UNK:UNK Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints.
UNK:UNK Yumm yumm yumm!   The burgers are fantastic and yummy!  The service has always been top notch, fast and freindly. Love the inside and outside environment.    Could do without the TVs with sports playing on them...don't we get enough plugged in entertainment in our lives already?....but I'm probably in the minority.  Kid friendly for those well behaved kids of course. :)
UNK:UNK Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!
UNK:UNK Lunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If it's easy-earned money and you don't care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just don't order the flat iron steak.
UNK:UNK In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.  With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesn't get any better.  The other locations are just as good.  The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location.
UNK:UNK An organized & clean store, a well educated & nice staff, a great selection of baby/kid products! I will never go to a babies r us again. Thank you Chandler buybuybaby!
UNK:UNK Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast.   Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five.   My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. can't go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied.
UNK:UNK I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here.
UNK:UNK Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way.
UNK:UNK I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
UNK:UNK Good place and food I'd very good for bar food. A bit pricey but good atmosphere. Great service.
UNK:UNK Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and you'll leave satisfied.
UNK:UNK Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!
UNK:UNK Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.  Staff and management were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend.
UNK:UNK great, family owned place that feels like the kind of italian joint that is made with love.   Food options are very good with traditional italian dishes and unique entrees that can't be found elsewhere.
UNK:UNK Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  We've been here three or four times and are never disappointed.
UNK:UNK Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.    *Service = really fast and nice *Food = good and healthy *Atmosphere = relaxing and cute *Brownie = yummy :)
UNK:UNK I'm glad that Cafe Rio Mexican Grill opened up in Town and Country.  We have been to Cafe Rio a couple of times now.  On Tuesday they have tacos for $1.50.  Cafe Rio is now my favorite place for tacos.  The beef and pork tacos are the best.  If you are looking for a good taco you should check out Cafe Rio.
UNK:UNK Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this????  Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!!  I would give 5 stars, bjt the service was...well, not great.  Its ok, we all have off days.  We'll be back!!!!
UNK:UNK Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.
UNK:UNK Yes, it's pricey, so I got a membership. Yes, the membership is pricey - but if you go frequently (and you'll want to with the hot summer months) you'll get your money's worth and then some. The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip. Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element, too!
UNK:UNK I like Rubio's in general, but this location is pretty hit or miss on the food quality and service.  I prefer the one on the other side of the I-10 next to the movie theater.
UNK:UNK I'm not impressed with their medium to high priced menu. Sushi is never cheap, but the quality of the sushi rolls and presentation is a bit messy and not impressive for the high-end decorated type of restaurant. I've had way better quality, presentation, and taste at other sushi restaurants that are not high-end. I guess we were paying for the ambiance and decorations more than anything.
UNK:UNK Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get! Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.  The place was very busy with allot of energy.
UNK:UNK You know, I've read some mixed reviews on this place. I enjoy going here. I think the pricing is reasonable, and I haven't had bad service. The food is pretty good (in comparison to other Phoenician Sushi restaurants).
UNK:UNK I've never been so impressed with the quality of food here, but it's fine for a chain American-Italian restaurant. But I am currently sitting here at a table, and have been for an hour, with no promise that a plate of food will be here in the near future. I'm not sure I will be back, I'm sure the Keg next door is better, and that's not saying all that much
UNK:UNK good coffee, friendly staff, good food.  they forgot to bring out the bagel I had ordered, but were very apologetic about it.  I will go here again.
UNK:UNK Getting boring in here.  It's been at least 6 months since they open but they have the same old flavors. I know you guys been busy but what happen to the "rotating flavors"???  Not sure if it's a seasonal thing or a cost factor but even the pomegranate toppings are gone (although they have pomegranate fro yo......not a fan of mine).  Competitions are moving in so change is not a bad thing.
UNK:UNK Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  There's not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  I'll have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon.
UNK:UNK Really fast and friendly service even during busier moments. The staff is also very helpful when asked to assist with using copiers and finding appropriate mailing supplies.
UNK:UNK T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!
UNK:UNK This is my favorite Pho place in Arizona.  The menu is diverse, an the staff is friendly.  They will answer any and all questions.  I've heard them giving "lessons" on how to eat pho several times.  The food is great, and the keep the drinks filled.  I've never had a complaint, and I've been there numerous times.  You will not be disappointed.
UNK:UNK A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours.
UNK:UNK Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.
UNK:UNK The Tavern on Mill is an average sports bar with cheap drinks and we come here to watch UFC fights because they don't charge a cover. We always leave when the fights end because there are better nightlife options in the area.
UNK:UNK Just went back here and had another fabulous meal - everything was so delicious and clearly homemade with care. Wonderful!
UNK:UNK It's the best!  Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!    The food is EXCELLENT!!!
UNK:UNK I had the fruits of the forest flavor and really enjoyed it.  Staff was very helpful.  Will definitely be coming back.
UNK:UNK This place is great!!! They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!! The food tastes great...don't forget to get a milkshake. It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!
UNK:UNK I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.  I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!
UNK:UNK This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here.
UNK:UNK Nice clean place with good food.  Shrimp burrito - pretty tasty.
UNK:UNK Wonderful low priced food. Love the fries! Love the Buffalo Hot wings, Good spicy chicken sandwich, good chili cheese fries, Good variety of burgers.  Fast service. I fight the urge to stop in almost daily!
UNK:UNK Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.
UNK:UNK One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!
UNK:UNK Love love love this place. It's a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service!
UNK:UNK Ugh. I used to like this place. But I've gotten over it.  I find the food to be uninspired, and below average.  Blah.
UNK:UNK The new leaner breakfast sandwiches are good (they basically take the bottom and top of the bagel and you are left with smaller ends of your sandwich). An easy way to cut calories without losing the taste.
UNK:UNK Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat! The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food! If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!
UNK:UNK Thanks to Yelp I was able to read they charge extra for the gas before freaking out on the people at the fron on my way out.   The staff was extreemly helpful and even told me there was one open spot close to the front. They were there ready to pick me up before I had my trunk open. The ride was smooth and direct.   As long as the car is there when I return this place rocks!
UNK:UNK As a massage therapist I normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted, that was before Dr. Hunt came to town.  I trust him implicitly, and the techniques he uses are amazing. I take my four year old to see him too, who always greets Dr. Hunt and Larissa with great big hugs. Highly recommend this office, truly feels like family
UNK:UNK DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it!  I'll be back for sure!  Welcome to the neighborhood.
UNK:UNK I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didn't have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins. I will be back again and again!!!!
UNK:UNK I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing...
UNK:UNK Made me and my bro sick. Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.
UNK:UNK best luck to wait in line for a guy behind the desk.  The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there.  This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products.  Weird vibe in this store.
UNK:UNK It's a taqueria in a Latino supermarket.  Nothing special but you have choices.   They will have just about everything you may like. It's not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want.  I'd go back if I just needed something quick....
UNK:UNK Ride the bulls gals and put on a show :) Just wear pants, please!! Fun spot to get drunk and do kinky things with cotton candy! Great happy hour specials!  Extremely generous bartenders and huge portions of food. Well worth the money!!
UNK:UNK Great bar with a friendly bartender named "Bob"
UNK:UNK I've been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!
UNK:UNK The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in the mood for a sub
UNK:UNK Found this place from yelp and had to check it out based on the great reviews. All I can say is wow! This place is super yummy! I have a new favorite! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. My only downfall was they don't accept Amex cards.
UNK:UNK I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
UNK:UNK Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldn't find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldn't even complain about the onions. Now that's saying something.
UNK:UNK I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!  It is super delicious and inexpensive!!  I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces...yummm.   Can't wait to go back.
UNK:UNK The best caesar salad i have ever had.  The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak.  The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful.
UNK:UNK Pretty lame subs and sandwiches. Worked close by so tried a few times. Hate to say it, but Subway is much better. Quality and quantity of ingredients in the so so bread left a lot to be desired.  Service was okay but nothing to Yelp positively about.
UNK:UNK Great service.  Tasty food.  I like it for lunch because later, I can skip dinner.  Their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds.  I like this place alot.  I think it lives up to the hype.
UNK:UNK This is thee place to indulge your sweet tooth. Great ice cream and ice cream creations from an establishment with deep roots and long pedigree in the ice cream biz.  Just can't be beat.
UNK:UNK only been here twice but the food kicked ass both times!  biscuits and gravy is the way to go here.  prices are right as well.  definately recommend this joint. seems to be about a 10 minute wait to get seated.  not bad.
UNK:UNK Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as well
UNK:UNK Yummy!
UNK:UNK My girlfriend i love, love, love this place. Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.   Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.  A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.  It's a total foodie destination.  This place is fantastic.  Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this.
UNK:UNK Service here is unfriendly at best ( i sat in the bar)menu both lunch and regular boring .chips ok salsa served in a small caraf which makes it inconvienent  to get salsa to chip. food was ok some of the chicken in my taco was dry do to the 8 million degree oven they put it in before serving to you . this place is a true tourist/youngen scottsdale hipsters joint
UNK:UNK I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.
UNK:UNK My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!
UNK:UNK Not much to write here. I always park on the Sears (upper level) side when I visit Chandler mall. My last visit to the mall, I ended up buying a luggage set on sale at Sears. The cashier was helpful and even checked to see if all four pieces were present (I didn't even think to, LOL). Four stars. No negative feedback to report.
UNK:UNK First time here--glad we came!  Free chips and salsa (always a great start to a Mexican meal!).  Hubby and I split the chicken fajitas, which were very tasty!  Good-sized portion with lots of red bell peppers, which we like. Served with side of rice and beans, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  We each ate our fill and still had enough for a take-home 'fajita burrito' :D
UNK:UNK I was quite impressed very charming and kinda romantic to have a nice lunch , The service was friendly and attentive the lunch specials were good too ! The only disapointing thing is there is no soda fountain but other than that it's all good the pasties were very tasty and I look forward to going back soon.
UNK:UNK The pork chop & eggs w/ home fries is out of control.  I feel the same way about this place as I do Roscoe's.... you don't go for an egg white omelet, you go to just enjoy yourself & eat some food that your grandparents used to make the old school way, butter & grease.  Just too darn good to pass up.
UNK:UNK Amazing food. I wasn't so sure about Indian food, as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself. I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic. I can't wait to go back!
UNK:UNK This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended
UNK:UNK Enjoyed lunch at the bar with my wife while on vacation.  The bartender was one of the owners, the wife half who works a full time job elsewhere and the rest of her free time at the restaurant.  Nice beer selection, just the right size floor plan with great outdoor space, and you could feel the care the new owners put into the place.  Great neighborhood cafe.
UNK:UNK Its a Wal-Mart, with a subway inside.
UNK:UNK Great food!  Great atmosphere! Great service.  Definitely recommend!!
UNK:UNK Was craving something different tried this place recommended by a friend. Was impressed with the lasagna. 30 min wait well worth it.   Service was ok food pretty good
UNK:UNK The consummate beer bar.  Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.  What more can you want from a drinking establishment?  The food is good too.
UNK:UNK a great place to spend an evening that has the taste of fine dining, but the feel of casual...the waitress was great...always one step ahead of us.....the desserts were wonderful and they comp'd the birthday dessert.... the portions were just right...even took some home for the next day.... we will be back....
UNK:UNK Spinato's has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though.  This restaurant was a Chili's before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable.  Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu.
UNK:UNK Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.
UNK:UNK Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy. Price and selection are awesome too!
UNK:UNK This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant. Good flavor, good service.  On occasion the fixings selection is a little "off". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics.
UNK:UNK Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.
UNK:UNK Great place for shows. Excellent place for everyone.
UNK:UNK I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is.
UNK:UNK My gang usually stumble in her at some point during our nights out and about in Old Town.  They have a decent selection of beers on tap and there are usually a couple tables open if you want to sit down. It's a bar, not a club, so don't expect much.  They have servers that are polite and prompt and the wait at the bar isn't usually very long.   Worth a stop to support a local biz.
UNK:UNK I love this gym! Everyone is so helpful and friendly. The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. I feel very well connected to all of the staff - they even know me by name! The trainers are extremely helpful also. I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone!
UNK:UNK Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!! Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow..
UNK:UNK Yummy!  We would go to Canter's in LA before I moved out here so this is a good comparable Pastrami Sandwich.  Very close to where we live which is great.  Prices are fine, a bit pricey, but oh well.  Overall, thumbs up!
UNK:UNK I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.  If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : (
UNK:UNK This place is very popular and I can see why...the food was incredible!  Cool, neighborhood place with good service.
UNK:UNK Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.   Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8). I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.     Nom nom.  Friendly staff.  See ya there!
UNK:UNK Fun, Fast, Easy, Yummy.  Nice Flatbread style pizzaz, done right, crispy, not thick & greasy. Yummy fresh & unique toppings.  Crisp salads.  Good place for kids :-)
UNK:UNK Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!
UNK:UNK Stopped in for Margs and appetizers.  Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK?  Holy MOLY what do they put in those things?  Food was great, drinks were better, I'll be back!
UNK:UNK It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.
UNK:UNK You can't give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bra's and panties to hot chicks.
UNK:UNK I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.
UNK:UNK Best donuts in the valley.  I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.
UNK:UNK Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.
UNK:UNK Great food, large portions! My family and I really enjoyed our Saturday morning breakfast.
UNK:UNK Fast, friendly, and clean.  You don't get to say that too often when describing a post office!  Serously though, these guys are great.
UNK:UNK Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!
UNK:UNK Ordered the famous "Butter Burger" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.  Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.
UNK:UNK Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!!
UNK:UNK I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!
UNK:UNK I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.  If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!
UNK:UNK I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle. I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight. Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious. Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go. SOOOO good! Also, servers are super nice and prompt. YAY!
UNK:UNK All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.
UNK:UNK So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didn't care were we went to eat as long is it had food.  I got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...don't ask.  The food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent.
UNK:UNK Great food and a fun atmosphere! service is a little slow, but the food is always delicious!
UNK:UNK I came, I saw, I conquered.   Would get five stars but parking here is difficult. No signs on where to park if u can't get in the iddy bitty teeny weeny parking lot. Walked an extra mile just to get to the entrance on the echo side
UNK:UNK One thing I like about this place...are the cacti! There are just everywhere! This is a great place to go camping in and to take lots of pictures of the scenery. The random people here are all very friendly and so are the staff from the Visitor Center.  The place definitely looks different when you compare from summer and winter.
UNK:UNK Some say you get what you pay for  (with an implication of regret) . But with ASMT, you get what you pay for and you actually walk out happy. An hour massage for $12.50?  Tell me where else can you get such good deal?
UNK:UNK Overall this place isn't so bad for a quick mexican food place. It's not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that. The food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price. I really liked their salsa and I felt it was nice and flavorful. I'd say this place is a small step up from Filbertos.  The staff here, however, were really rude. They seemed to want to rush everyone around.
UNK:UNK I have to tell you....  I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!
UNK:UNK I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!
UNK:UNK Quick, friendly, awesome.
UNK:UNK Fair pricing and no upselling. These guys are good--but be warned, it's as busy as an angry beehive on Monday mornings!
UNK:UNK Wonderful drink options, the food was pretty great as well
UNK:UNK We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!
UNK:UNK They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you.
UNK:UNK Staff was quick and efficient. Food was delicious.
UNK:UNK I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back
UNK:UNK I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly.
UNK:UNK Great fresh food Great people Great price... support your local businesses!!!
UNK:UNK Order was supposed to be ready 20 min ago...yet here I am still waiting...not even busy!
UNK:UNK Yelp search for vegan food led me and my mom here nice little place on a beautiful golf course. Friendly, knowledgable staff made my inner server glow when they knew which plate went where. Quite a few vegan dishes, delicious local wines. I really dug that they took a lot of local ingredients and added a nice flair to their menu. Glad I came!
UNK:UNK Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games.
UNK:UNK In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice.
UNK:UNK NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.    One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.
UNK:UNK Have tried this place a few times now we sometimes order it for everyone at work. My impression is that its a step up from Taco Bell.
UNK:UNK The "Protein Pancakes" are always a treat, but the "California Eggs Benedict" was just awful today.  The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though.  They tasted like shredded cardboard.  I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results.  Shame on you US Egg!
UNK:UNK Good choice for dim sum. Prompt efficient service, good food and reasonable prices.
UNK:UNK I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced.  The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit.  Parking is awful.
UNK:UNK Great meal all-around.  Was hoping for an authentic experience...and that is what we received from start to finish.  Really enjoyed the grilled lamb and chicken, with garlic sauce on the side, and a Turkish coffee to finish.  Service was attentive and friendly.  The staff was clearly proud of their food/restaurant, as they should be...  Highly recommend!
UNK:UNK As far as salon-cafes go, this has got to be one of the better ones.  The sandwiches, while not particularly ground breaking, are thoughtful and assembled with quality components.  Also has a pretty good old-town ambiance.
UNK:UNK Toasted subs at their best..   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.  And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal.
UNK:UNK I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.
UNK:UNK Food is a little pricer than standard Chili's, but it's in an airport so that's expected. Service was good, food came out quickly and to order. Be sure to stop by before you head through security.
UNK:UNK I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.    My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.  I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!
UNK:UNK It's just fun and I'll be back ! Very chill.
UNK:UNK A total oasis from the summer heat.  This friendly and well stocked neighborhood library is never crowded, so you can alway grab a free PC or a free table if you're lugging your own laptop.  The selection of books and dvds are really good too.
UNK:UNK I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame. I hope that I can volunteer here.
UNK:UNK Being a long time devotee of the Gelato Spot, I never gave this place a shot.  I must admit, the Marscapone gelato was very good.   I probably won't switch from Gelato Spot because parking is so much more convenient at 32nd & Camelback.  However, the next time I am out for a walk in the area or am in the mood for a sweet treat after dinner at Postino or LGO, I will definitely pop in.
UNK:UNK I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections haven't changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good. I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there.
UNK:UNK Loved it. Food was great, service was great. Not easy to find, but worth the search!!!
UNK:UNK Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!
UNK:UNK By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Food and Salsa amazing! Service phenomenal! Great prices!!!!
UNK:UNK great happy hour.  always comfortable, nice staff. we'll return often.
UNK:UNK Sprouts is great, they have a wonderful selection of fruits and veggies and their sausage is made in house and really wonderful on the grill!  The grab and go meals are perfect for a quick dinner and the sandwiches and soups are spot on for lunch.  Very friendly and helpful staff.
UNK:UNK Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.
UNK:UNK I love paletas. I found this place through Yelp and loved what everyone said. I grew up in South Phoenix and I do remember the paleta carts rolling around. Since those aren't around I had to find an alternative.   I do recommend this place however for me $3 / paleta is quite high. They used to be $1.    FYI: It's cash only.
UNK:UNK Dined outside. It's a must do when the weather is right. Fit's nicely into the 'Fashion Square' mentality an aura. Great appetizers and they did a great job on the steak. We'll go back again sometime.
UNK:UNK Horrible service.
UNK:UNK Sandwiches are pretty decent and tasty..however..  they don't include drinks, salad, just a small cookie on the side. We just ordered 2 sanwiches and 2 sodas, a little on the overpriced side, totaled out to $27 just for that. The sandwiches are gigantic or anything. just left feeling a bit hungry and disappointed.
UNK:UNK I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a "petite" burger. It is smaller but has the same toppings you order on the regular. So for those of you that don't want to have a burger that is 1000 calories (yes they are and more with the endless fries) , try the petite.
UNK:UNK So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time.  There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,,   Service was promt though!
UNK:UNK It is a salad bar.
UNK:UNK Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover.  I order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent. Independent & yummy.
UNK:UNK We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
UNK:UNK Went there with the Wife. Lots of stuff for the ladies. I would lay off making any real purchase here on my own, I would of course consult the Mrs. In regards to what she might like. Way to tough to try and pick something out in here (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.) that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on. Nice place, very friendly staff, warm, and inviting one to buy.
UNK:UNK LOVE Five Guys!
UNK:UNK No more dinner hours! :(
UNK:UNK This place is always one of the first places my husband and I go to, once we are in a city that has one. Having lived in Phoenix for around 10 years, this has always been one of my favorites. Recently they have added new rolls and sushi to their menu, and I must say, Great job!
UNK:UNK This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The "Asada y Enchilada" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere.
UNK:UNK "Hipster,Trendy" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !
UNK:UNK Standard Mexican fare - but quite delicious.  Pitcher of frozen margaritas was yummy, too.  Fast and friendly service.
UNK:UNK Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo on Dobson and Southern. Typical taco bell food and service. Lunch is very busy at this location because it is within walking distance of MCC, Pima Medical Institute, Banner Desert Hospital and a gazillion apartment complexes.  Parking is easy, but this shopping center is very difficult to get in or out of during rush hour.
UNK:UNK Great breakfast place and much better than Panera. Tried the lemon pancake....mmmm very good. Also had the portabella sandwich....too much on tomato but still good. After eating my gf let out a big burp in front of everyone.....well done.  They have some breads that you can buy here as well.
UNK:UNK I thought I had reviewed this location already?  Weird.  The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).  You all know about the food and you either love it or you hate it but I just like this location since there is usually not much of a line, at least in the evenings.
UNK:UNK The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).  i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.  A few of my favs are:  - Chicken Salad Sandwich - Southwest Ranch Salad - Omelets  Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)
UNK:UNK Wow!  Went on a Sunday around 11am - busy but not packed.  Roomy and comfortable.  GREAT food.  Bacon meaty and tasy.  I had the french toast on recommendation and it was fantastic.  Great atmosphere...just an all around great place.  We were in from LA for a baseball game and wanted a non-chain local place and found this place on Yelp.  Glad we went!
UNK:UNK Highly recommend. This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way. I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp "no melted cheese") I do recommend both plates. Next time I will try (ropa vieja) Great service! Ask for Kelly.
UNK:UNK 5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.  Service was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well.
UNK:UNK Best corned beef sandwich I've had anywhere at anytime. Definitely great portions of food. The jewish sliders are very good especially with the potato pancakes. Too bad they aren't in California because I can see myself visiting this a lot.
UNK:UNK Awesome food! Little pricey but delicious. Loved the power pancakes!
UNK:UNK The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I don't know what else to say.
UNK:UNK Great food and service! Country food at its best!
UNK:UNK Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.
